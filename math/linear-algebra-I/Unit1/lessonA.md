\textbf{Field}: A non-empty set $F$ with two operations, called $addition$ and $multiplication$.\\

\textbf{Field Axioms}: \\
Addition Axioms
1) $a + (b + c) = (a+b) + c$ for all $a,b,c$ in $F$. \\
2) There exists an element $0$ in $F$ such that $a+0 = a = 0+a$  for all $a$ in $F$. It is called the $zero$ $element$ of $F$. \\
3) For each element $a$ of $F$ there exists an element $b$ of $F$ such that $a + b = 0 = b + a$. $b$ is uniquely determined by $a$ and is called the $negative$ of $a$. \\
4) $a+b = b+a$ for all $a,b$ in $F$.\\
Multiplication Axioms\\
5)  $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ for all $a,b,c$ in $F$.\\
6) $a(bc) = (ab)c$ for all $a,b,c$ in $F$.\\
7) There exists a nonzero element 1 in $F$ such that $1\cdot a = a = a\cdot 1$. \\
8) For each nonzero element $a$ of $F$ there exists an element $b$ of $F$ such that $ab = 1 = ba$. $b$ is uniquely determined by $a$, is nonzero, and is called the $reciprocal$ or $inverse$ of $a$. \\
9) $ab = ba$ for all $a,b$ in $F$. \\

\textbf{Function}: A function $f: X \to Y$, assigns, to each element $x$ of the set $X$, a corresponding element in the set $Y$
