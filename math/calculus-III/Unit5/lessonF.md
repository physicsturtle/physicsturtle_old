The curl is an operation which can only be defined in three dimensions. 


#### Frequently Asked Questions

If we want to define curl in a different coordinate system, such as spherical, can we use the same definition? That is, if \\(\textbf{F} = F_r\hat{\textbf{r}} + F_\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}+F_\varphi\hat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}\\), can we say that

$$ \nabla\times\textbf{F} = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{\textbf{r}} & \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} & \hat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}} \\  \frac{\partial}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial}{\partial\varphi} \\ F_r & F_\theta & F_\varphi \end{vmatrix} ?$$

The answer is **no**.
