In single variable calculus, we had functions of the form \\(y = f(x)\\), with a single variable depending on a single variable. In the last unit, we had functions of the form \\(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), which was multiple variables \\((x,y,z\\)) depending on a single variable, \\(t\\). Here, we will be looking at functions which depend on multiple variables, for example \\(z = f(x,y)\\), or \\(u = f(x,y,z)\\).
