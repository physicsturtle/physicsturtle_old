title: TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
course: calculus-III
unit: unit4
---

- the jacobiuan for cylindrical coordinates -- geometric derivation and determinant derivation
- Setting up integral in cylindrical coordinates
- Changing order of integration in cylindrical coordinates

When the system of interest presents cylindrical symmetry, integrals are often made simpler by switching to a different coordinate system. As in the case of polar coordinates, this requires us to change the volume element of integration.
