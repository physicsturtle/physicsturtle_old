Often in single variable calculus, we had functions of the form \\(y = f(x\\); a single variable input and single variable output. Something else could write is \\(x = f(t)\\), where, physically, this means the position \\(x\\) of a particle as a function of the time \\(t\\).

It is often more interesting to consider a particle moving in 2 or 3 dimensions. Let's consider a function \\(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t))\\), or \\(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), describing the *vector valued* position of a particle in 2 or 3 dimensions. These functions trace out a curve in 2 or 3 dimensions as time is increased

Since parametric equations are just vector valued functions, they can be added and subtracted and multiplied by scalars. The dot or cross product can also be taken between two vector valued functions. Similarly with the magnitude.
