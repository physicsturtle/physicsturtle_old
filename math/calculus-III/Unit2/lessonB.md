We now want to discuss how to differentiate vector valued functions. This is done in the obvious way; that is, if \\(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), we define the componentwise differentiation

$$ \frac{d\textbf{r}}{dt} = \left(\frac{dx}{dt},\frac{dy}{dt},\frac{dz}{dt}\right).$$

Geometrically, \\(\textbf{r}'(t)\\) represents the *tangent* vector to the curve at the point \\(\textbf{r}(t)\\).
