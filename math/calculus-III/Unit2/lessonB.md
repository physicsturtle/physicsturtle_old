Often in single variable calculus, we had functions of the form \\(y = f(x\\); a single variable input and single variable output. Something else could write is \\(x = f(t)\\), where, physically, this means the position \\(x\\) of a particle as a function of the time \\(t\\). 

(make javascript of particle moving)

It is often more interesting to consider a particle moving in 2 or 3 dimensions. Let's consider a function \\(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t))\\), or \\(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), describing the *vector valued* position of a particle in 2 or 3 dimensions.
