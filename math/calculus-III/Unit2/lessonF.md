- Relationship between tangent, normal, binormal vectors and their derivatives
- Conventions for the frenet serret equations

The Frenet-Serret Equations are a set of three relationships between the unit tangent vector, normal vector, and binormal vector. They can be used to prove important properties of curves, as well as existence and uniqueness theorems. However, we will limit our discussion to only their definition, and the Frenet frame.
