Here we will derive a useful formula for differentiating integrals. Suppose I have a function \\(g\\):

$$g(x) = \int_a^b f(x,y) dy$$

How do we differentiate this (with respect to \\(x\\))? Well, let's apply the definition of the derivative. 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
g'(x) &=& \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}\\
&=& \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\left(\int_a^b f(x+h,y) dy - \int_a^b f(x,y) dy\right)\\
&=& \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\int_a^b f(x+h,y) - f(x,y) dy\\
&=& \int_a^b \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)}{h}dy\\
&=& \int_a^b \partial_x f(x,y)dy\\
\end{eqnarray}$$

so we see that the ordinary derivative becomes a partial derivative when it igoes inside the integral. 

Now we consider a more complicated case. For this case, we will need to use the chain rule.
