In single variable calculus, we were interested in finding the minima and maxima of a function, and this was done by looking at where the derivative is zero. An analogous procedure will be done here.

#### First Derivative Test
The first derivative test in single variable calculus told us where the tangent line had slope zero, and thus, where the minima and maxima were. Here, taking the gradient of a function, or, all the partial derivatives, will tell us where the *tangent plane* has zero slope in all directions.
