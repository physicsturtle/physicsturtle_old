In your first course on calculus, all of the functions were of a single variable, for example \\(y = f(x)\\). We have the *dependent variable* \\(y\\), depending on the *independent variable* \\(x\\). This can be represented graphically by something like (insert graph here).

We now introduce the three dimensional coordinate system \\((x,y,z)\\). It now requires three numbers to specify any point in space! This looks like (insert figure here).


In this three dimensional coordinate system, space is divided up into 8 different *octants*. We call the octant with all of \\(x,y,z\\) positive the *first octant*. Note how this coordinate system has been drawn. It is called a *right-handed* coordinate system. This can be contrasted with a *left-handed* coordinate system. It is convention to **always** use a right-handed coordinate system. 

The set of points constituting our three dimensional space is known as \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\). When drawing points in three dimensional space, it is very useful to draw lines parallel to the axes, like so, to show where the point fits in space. Learning to draw clear three dimensional figures will be very useful.
