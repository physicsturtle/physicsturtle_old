The cross product is one of the two ways of multiplying vectors. It can only be defined between vectors in exactly 3 dimensions. Despite this, there are ways to think about the cross product in 2 dimensions. Additionally, definitions of the cross product can be made in more than 3 dimensions, but that is outside the scope of this course.
