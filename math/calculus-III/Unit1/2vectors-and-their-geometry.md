In the previous lesson, we talked about points in three dimensional space. Now we will discuss the concept of direction in space. A *vector* in three dimensional space is an ordered triplet \\(\textbf{v} = (a,b,c)\\), where \\(a,b,c\\) are each real numbers. This is represented visually by drawing an arrow from the origin to the point \\((a,b,c)\\). The numbers \\(a,b,c\\) are known as the *components* of the vector, where \\(a\\) is the \\(x\\) component, \\(b\\) the \\(y\\) component, and \\(c\\) the \\(z\\) component. Just as important are vector in two dimensional space, written as \\((a,b)\\). 

It is often useful to translate the vector around in space, while keeping all of its components the same. This means that the vector's starting point and ending point will both change, but that the difference of the two stay the same. Thus the two vectors in the following figure are actually the same vector, even though they begin at different points.

In this course, vectors will always be denoted by boldface letters, for example, \\(\textbf{v} = (a,b,c)\\). If written by hand, this is most often done as \\( \vec{v} = (a,b,c)\\). In more advanced mathematics, this special notation is often dropped altogether, writing \\(v = (a,b,c)\\). We will not be writing vectors in such a way in this course. Now let's discuss operations with vectors from a geometric standpoint. Vectors can be geometrically added *tip to tail* by drawing the tip of one on top of the tail of the other. For example, in two dimensions,

The same aproach works in three dimensions, although it may be harder to draw. 

In order to subtract vectors geometrically, we need to introduce the *negative* of a vector. The negative of a vector has the same magnitude but the exact opposite direction.
