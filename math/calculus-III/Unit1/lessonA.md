title: THREE DIMENSIONAL CARTESIAN COORDINATES
course: calculus-III
unit: unit1
---

In your first course on calculus, all of the functions were of a single variable, for example \\(y = f(x)\\). We have the *dependent variable* \\(y\\), depending on the *independent variable* \\(x\\). This can be represented graphically by something like (insert graph here). 



We now introduce the three dimensional coordinate system \\((x,y,z)\\). It now requires three numbers to specify any point in space! This looks like

In this three dimensional coordinate system, space is divided up into 8 different *octants*. We call the octant with all of \\(x,y,z\\) positive the *first octant*. Note how this coordinate system has been drawn. It is called a *right-handed* coordinate system. This can be contrasted with a *left-handed* coordinate system. It is convention to **always** use a right-handed coordinate system.

The set of points constituting our three dimensional space is known as \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\). When drawing points in three dimensional space, it is very useful to draw lines parallel to the axes, like so, to show where the point fits in space. Learning to draw clear three dimensional figures will be very useful. 

### Exercises
<ol> 
<li><div> Plot the points \((2,-1,2)\), \((-3,-3,1)\), and \((0,2,-1)\) on a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. </div>

<button onclick="myFunction('answer1')" class="answerButton">Show Answer</button>
<div  id="answer1" class="answer">
To plot these points, we should draw lines from each of the axes to show where the points are. Without these lines, it could be ambiguous where points are. 
</div> </li>
<li> <div> Sketch all of the points such that \(y = 1\). </div>
