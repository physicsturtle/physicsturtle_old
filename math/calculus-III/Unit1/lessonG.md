There are a few different ways to define a line in three dimensional space. 

### Parametric Form of a Line
A parametric equation is not a relationship between the spatial variables, but instead is a function of a *parameter*, usually \\(t\\) for time, that, as it is increased, traces out the line. 

We learned before that we can draw a  vector \\(\textbf{r}_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)\\) pointing from the origin to the point \\((x_0,y_0,z_0)\\).

### Equation Form of a Line

I personally don't like this way of defining a line. I find it opaque and cumbersome. Nonetheless, we should know what it is and how to work with it.
