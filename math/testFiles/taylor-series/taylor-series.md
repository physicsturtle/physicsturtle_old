If we are to approximate a function with a polynomial, then the function and polynomial must have the same value at a point, and the same derivative evaluated at that same point, the same second derivative at the point, and so forth. In other words, $f(0) = P(0)$, $P'(0) = f'(0)$, $P''(0) = f''(0)$, and the $n$th derivative of both the polynomial and function must be equal at zero. This polynomial approximation works only if the function is continuously differentiable. When the polynomial satisfies all of these conditions, it will be equal to the function not just at zero, but everywhere. This may result in an infinite series.

When the polynomial is approximated around zero, it is known as a Maclaurin Series. A Maclaurin Series is a special case of a Taylor series, which can be approximated around any point.

As more terms are added to the polynomial, it becomes closer and closer to the function itself.
