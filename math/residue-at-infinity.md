The residue at infinity is a useful quantity to calculate for certain integrals which have many singularities within a certain region. The residue at infinity allows one to calculate a single residue to find the value of the integral instead of many and summing them up. 

Suppose we have the Laurent expansion of a function $f(z)$, which is valid outside of a certain region $|z| > R$. Thus we express it as 

$$f(z) \sim \frac{a_{-1}}{z} + \frac{a_{-2}}{z^2} + \cdots $$
