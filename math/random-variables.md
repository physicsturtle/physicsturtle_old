Suppose we have a sample space \\(\Omega\\). Then a random variable on this space is a function 

$$X : \Omega \to E$$

If, for example, the set \\(E\\) is the real numbers, we could ask what the probability is that \\(X\\) is less than a certain value. To do this, we need to find the event (subset of \\(\Omega\\)) that leads to \\(X\\) being less than this threshold. Consider the set 

$$\{a | X(a) < x\} \subset \Omega $$
