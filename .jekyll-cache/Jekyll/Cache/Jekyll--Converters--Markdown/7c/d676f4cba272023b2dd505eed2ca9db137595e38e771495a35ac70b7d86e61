I"®<p>When I was an undergrad, there were always courses which didnâ€™t go into as much detail as I wanted, or that I never had time to take at all! There were also courses which were too abstract, too applied, or just about right. I aim here to produce the degree that I would have wanted to take if I were to start over as an undergrad.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide a physics and mathematics reference for self study or as a supplement to your coursework.</p>

<p>I have organized the material here according to what my understanding of the conventional curriculum is for Canadian/American academic institutions. If youâ€™re from elsewhere, I hope it isnâ€™t too difficult for you to find what you need.</p>

<p>As for the author, I am currently a graduate student studying theoretical physics, in particular condensed matter. I have been interested in education for several years now, and have been trying to get this project off the ground for almost as long. The website was created on June 3, 2018, and I would like to have most of my planned content finished by 2030. The website was last updated on 2019-10-13 19:15.</p>
