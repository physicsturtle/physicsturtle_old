I"	<p>The partial derivatives represent the rate of change of a function in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions. It is also possible to calculate the rate of change of a function in any direction in the \(xy\) plane. This is called the directional derivative. Suppose we’re interesting in calculating the derivative of a function \(f(x,y)\) in the direction of the <em>unit vector</em> \(\hat{\textbf{u}}  = (a,b)\). We define this as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">D_\hat{\textbf{u}}f = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+ah,y+bh) - f(x,y)}{h}</script>

<p>How do we go about calculating this? Define the function \(g(h) = f(x+ah,y+bh)\). We then recognize that the formula defined above is actually</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">D_\hat{\textbf{u}} f = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(h) - g(0)}{h} = g'(0)</script>

<p>There is another way to calculate \(g’(0)\), and that is by the chain rule. The derivative of \(g\) is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
g'(h) &=& \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{d}{dh}(x+ah) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{d}{dh}(y+bh)\\
&=& a\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + b\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\\
&=& \nabla f \cdot\hat{\textbf{u}}
\end{eqnarray} %]]></script>

<p>where the derivative \(\partial f/\partial x \) actually means the derivative with respect to the <em>first argument</em>, or, \(x+ah\). When we plug in \(h = 0\), we get</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">g'(0) = \nabla f \cdot \hat{\textbf{u}}</script>

<p>where now the gradient is evaluated at \((x,y)\), because \(h = 0\).</p>

<p>Matching these two, we get that</p>

<div class="result">
$$D_\hat{\textbf{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot\hat{\textbf{u}}$$ </div>

<p>Thus we have our formula for the directional derivative.</p>
