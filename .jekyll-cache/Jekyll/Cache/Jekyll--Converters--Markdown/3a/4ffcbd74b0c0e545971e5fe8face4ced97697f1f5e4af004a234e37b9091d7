<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{H}^0 \left| \psi^0_n\right>  = E^0_n \left| \psi^0_n \right></script>

<p>We then look for how these energy eigenvalues and their states change when we change the Hamiltonian to $\hat{H} = \hat{H}^0 + \lambda \hat{H}â€™$. Note that when we do perturbation theory in quantum mechanics, we usually have that $\hat{H}â€™$ is a small Hamiltonian, and ramp the parameter $\lambda$ up to 1 at the end. In mathematics courses on asymptotic analysis (perturbation theory), one usually keeps $\lambda$ as a small parameter.</p>

<p>We define power series to describe</p>
