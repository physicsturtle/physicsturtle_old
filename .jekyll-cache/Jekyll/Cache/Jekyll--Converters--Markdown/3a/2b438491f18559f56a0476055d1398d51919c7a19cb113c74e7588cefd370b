I"Õ<p>What we have learned about tensors so far can be applied to any vector space. Here, we are concerned with tensors on the vector space $\R^4$. In general relativity, we concern ourselves with tensors on the tangent spaces to a manifold, but that is more general than what we require here. The knowledge of tensors on $\R^4$ is sufficient for special relativity and classical field theory, and many ideas which we develop here can be generalized to curved spaces.</p>
