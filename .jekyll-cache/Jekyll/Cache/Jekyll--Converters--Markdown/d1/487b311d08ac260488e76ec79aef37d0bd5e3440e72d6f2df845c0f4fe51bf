I"w<p>Here we will investigate one of the methods of evaluating integrals asymptotically.</p>

<p>Suppose we had the integral</p>

\[I = \int_0^1 \frac{\sin(x)}{\epsilon^2 + x^2} dx\]

<p>As $\epsilon\to 0$, the integral becomes logarithmically divergent. One way to simplify the problem is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int_0^1 \frac{\sin(x)}{\epsilon^2 + x^2} dx 
\end{eqnarray}\]
