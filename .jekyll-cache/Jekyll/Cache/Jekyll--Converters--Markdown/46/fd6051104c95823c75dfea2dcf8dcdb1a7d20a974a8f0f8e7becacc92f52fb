I"¯<p>Suppose we have a sample space \(\Omega\). Then a random variable on this space is a function</p>

\[X : \Omega \to E\]

<p>If, for example, the set \(E\) is the real numbers, we could ask what the probability is that \(X\) is less than a certain value. To do this, we need to find the event (subset of \(\Omega\)) that leads to \(X\) being less than this threshold. Consider the set</p>

\[\{a | X(a) &lt; x\} \subset \Omega\]
