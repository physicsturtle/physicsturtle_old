I"<p>Suppose we have a sample space \(\Omega\). Then a random variable on this space is a function</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">X : \Omega \to E</script>

<p>If, for example, the set \(E\) is the real numbers, we could ask what the probability is that \(X\) is less than a certain value. To do this, we need to find the event (subset of \(\Omega\)) that leads to \(X\) being less than this threshold. Consider the set</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\{a | X(a) < x\} \subset \Omega %]]></script>
