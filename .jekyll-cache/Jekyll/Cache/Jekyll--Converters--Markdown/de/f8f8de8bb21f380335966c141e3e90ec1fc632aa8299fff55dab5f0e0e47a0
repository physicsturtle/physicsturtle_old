Definition: A quadric surface is represented by an equation of the form 

$$Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Eyz + Fzx + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0$$
</div>

<p>This class of surfaces includes spheres, ellipsoids, paraboloids, and hyperboloids, as well as a collection of cylinder-like surfaces.</p>

<p>Definition: A sphere centred at the origin of radius $a$ has the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2 = a^2$. A sphere centred at the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ of radius $a$ has equation
[(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = a^2<br />

Definition: A cylinder is a surface that has the same cross section no matter where you slice it. This means that exactly one of the variables, $x,y,z$ is missing.</p>

<p>This is different from our normal definition of a cylinder, which has a circular cross section. We can also define cylinders of other cross sections such as ellipses or parabolas.</p>

<p>Definition: An ellipsoid has equation
<script type="math/tex">\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1</script>
An ellipsoid which is centred at $x_0,y_0,z_0$ has equation 
<script type="math/tex">\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-y_0)^2}{b^2} + \frac{(z-z_0)^2}{c^2} = 1</script></p>
