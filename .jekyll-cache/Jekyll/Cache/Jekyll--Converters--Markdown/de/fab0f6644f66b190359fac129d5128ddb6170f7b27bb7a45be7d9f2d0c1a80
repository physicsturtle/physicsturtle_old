I"]<p>When I was first learning about different coordinate systems, I was never able to easily find a discussion on changing coordinates that was to my satisfaction. Here, I hope to remedy that situation for anybody who is learning about changing coordinates for their math or physics courses. This section is going to depart from the geometric arguments that weâ€™ve used in the past to justify things like the volume element in spherical coordinates and such. Unfortunately, everything stems from the use of Cartesian coordinates and the definitions of gradient, divergence, and curl in terms of them.</p>
