I"¼<p>Recall the definition of the torsion tensor $T$ with respect to a connection $\nabla$, which is</p>

\[T(X,Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X,Y]\]

<p>where $[X,Y]$ is the Lie bracket on vector fields. A connection $\nabla$ is said to be torsion-free if the corresponding torsion tensor $T$ vanishes for any vector fields $X,Y$. If the connection if torsion-free, then we have the following identity.</p>
