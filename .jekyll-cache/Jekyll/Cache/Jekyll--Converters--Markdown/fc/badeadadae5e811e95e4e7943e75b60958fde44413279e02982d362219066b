I"‚<p>We consider a system and construct the conservation of energy. In a physical system, there are different ways to add energy to it. The energy $E$ in a system does not have a general formula. However, we can find a formula for the change in energy in a system due to changes in thermodynamic quantities. The change in energy is</p>

\[dE = TdS - PdV + \mu dN.\]

<p>In multivariable calculus, taking the differential of a function leads to a sum in terms of differentials of the independent variables. This tells us then that $E = E(S,V,N)$, and that</p>

\[T = \frac{\partial E}{\partial S}\bigg|_{V,N},\qquad -P = \frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\bigg|_{S,N},\qquad \mu = \frac{\partial E}{\partial N}\bigg|_{S,V}.\]

<p>If we define $F = E - TS$, then taking the differential leads to</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray*}

dF &amp;=&amp; dE - d(TS)\\

&amp;=&amp; (TdS - PdV + \mu dN) - (TdS + SdT) \\

&amp;=&amp; -SdT - PdV + \mu dN

\end{eqnarray*}\]

<p>This means that we can change $E$ from being a function of $S$ into being a function of $T$.</p>

\[d(E-TS) = -SdT - PdV + \mu dN\]

<p>Thus,</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray*}

-S &amp;=&amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial T}\bigg|_{V,N}(E - TS) \\

&amp;=&amp; \frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\bigg|_{V,N} - \frac{\partial(TS)}{\partial T}\bigg|_{V,N} \\

&amp;=&amp; \frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\bigg|_{V,N} - S - T\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\bigg|_{V,N}

\end{eqnarray*}\]
