I"ê<p>First, letâ€™s get some notation straight. We define the Heaviside function</p>

\[u(t) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
0, &amp; t&lt;0 \\
1, &amp; t &gt; 0
\end{array}  \right.\]

<p>and then the shifted Heaviside function as \(u(t-a) = u_a(t)\).</p>

<p>The delta function \(\delta(t)\) canâ€™t be defined in the same way. That is, in terms of a piecewise expression. It does indeed have the value of 0 at every value of \(t\) except \(t = 0\). However, its value is not defined at \(t = 0\). It does have the property that</p>

\[\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t) dt = \int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon \delta(t) dt = 1\]

<p>no matter how small \(\epsilon\) is, as long as it is positive. What this means is that the delta function has area 1, despite being zero everywhere except at \(T = 0\).</p>

<p>The definition of the Laplace Transform is</p>

\[F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt\]
