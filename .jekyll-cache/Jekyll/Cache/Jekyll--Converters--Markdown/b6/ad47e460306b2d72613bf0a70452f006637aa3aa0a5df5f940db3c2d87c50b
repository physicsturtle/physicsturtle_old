<p>There are many functions whose inverse function is multi-valued. For example, inverting any of the following functions (for complex $z$)</p>

\[f(z) = z^2, \qquad f(z) = \sin z,\qquad f(z) = \cos z,\qquad f(z) = e^z\]

<p>will produce multiple values. In the world of calculus of a real variable, all of these have mutivalued inverses except the exponential. In the calculus of complex variables, we have to recall the polar form of complex numbers $z = re^{i\theta}$. Notice that changing $\theta$ by $2\pi$ would produce the same value of $z$. Thus, if we take the logarithm of both sides, we get $\log z = \log r + i(\theta + 2\pi n)$, where $n\in \Z$. Thus $\log z$ can take multiple values.</p>

<p>To visualize how these multivalued inverse mappings work, consider $w = f(z)$, where $f(z)$ is a single valued function. The multivalued inverse goes from the $w$ plane to the $z$ plane, and maps the same value of $z$ to different values of $w$.</p>

<p>(insert many to one inverse schematic here)</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Strictly speaking, a <em>multivalued function</em> isn’t a function at all! It is simply terminology that we use in complex analysis to describe the kinds of relations that we are studying in this section.</p>

<h3 id="logarithm-function">Logarithm Function</h3>
<p>All multivalued function inverses in complex analysis can be related back to the logarithm function, so we study the logarithm first. Suppose we have the equation 
\(z = e^w;\)
we want to solve for $w$ in terms of $z$ (note that this is the opposite of the notation that we used in the introduction, where it was $w = e^z$). For a given $z = re^{i\theta}$, where $\theta = \Arg(z)$ (recall that $-\pi &lt; \Arg(z) \leq \pi$), we want to write $w = u + iv$. The equation is thus 
\(r e^{i\theta} = e^{u + iv}.\)</p>

<p>This allows us to work entirely in terms of real numbers! If we take the magnitude of both sides, then we find that $r = e^u$. Thus, $u = \ln r$. We use $\ln$ here to mean the natural logarithm of real argument only. This is conventional in complex analysis; for the (multivalued) natural logarithm of a complex number, we use $\log$. For the imaginary part, we get $v = \theta + 2\pi n = \Arg(z) + 2\pi n$, where $n\in \Z$ is any integer. Putting these together, and recalling that $r = |z|$ and $\theta = \Arg(z)$, we have our expression for $w$:</p>

\[w = u + iv = \ln|z| + i[\Arg(z) + 2\pi n].\]

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $z\in\C$ be a complex number. Then, we define the <i>multivalued logarithm of $z$</i> to be
$$\log z = \ln|z| + i(\Arg(z) + 2\pi n).$$
</div>

<p>This definition is equivalent to saying that</p>

\[\log z = \ln|z| + i\arg(z),\]

<p>because $\arg z$ is multivalued. It is possible to define a single valued logarith by simply picking one value for its imaginary part. We call this value the <em>principal value</em>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $z\in \C$ be a complex number. Then, we define the <i>principal value of the logarithm of $z$</i> to be 
$$\Log z = \ln |z| + i\Arg(z).$$
</div>

<h3 id="continuity-of-the-logarithm">Continuity of the Logarithm</h3>
<p>We now examine the continuity of the logarithm. Since $\Log z$ is an actual function (because it is single valued), this is actually a valid question. If we consider any point on the negative real axis, or, the line $\theta = \pm \pi$.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we consider $z = x + i\epsilon$ for $x &lt; 0$ and and $\epsilon\to 0^+$, then $\log z \to \ln|x| + i\pi$.</li>
  <li>If we consider $z = x + i\epsilon$ for $x &lt; 0$ and $\epsilon \to 0^-$, then $\log z \to \ln|x| - i\pi$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the limits from opposite sides don’t agree, so $\Log z$ is not continuous across the line $z = x$ for $x &lt; 0$.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Calculate the following values of the logarithm:
<ol type="a">
<li> $\log(i)$ </li>
<li> $\log(-i + \sqrt{3})$ </li>
<li> $\Log(-2+2i)$ </li>
</ol> </p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li> $\log(i)$ </li>
<li> $\log(-i + \sqrt{3})$ </li>
<li> $\Log(-2+2i)$ </li>
</ol>

<p>There are certain identities which hold for the multivalued logarithm $\log$ which do not hold for the single valued logarithm $\Log$, and vice versa.</p>

<h3 id="exponents">Exponents</h3>
<p>Suppose $\alpha\in\C$ and $z\in\C$ is a nonzero number. Then, we can consider the function $f(z) = z^\alpha$.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Suppose $\alpha\in\C$ and $z\in\C$ is a nonzero number. Then, we define $z^\alpha$ to be the multivalued function
$$z^\alpha = e^{\alpha\log z} = e^{\alpha[\ln|z| + i\Arg(z) + 2\pi n]},\qquad n\in \Z.$$
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This definition can be further explored in certain subcases.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Suppose $\alpha = \beta + \gamma i$. If $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are both rational numbers, then $z^\alpha$ is a finite set of numbers.</li>
  <li>If $\alpha = \beta + \gamma i$ and $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are both integers, then $z^\alpha$ is a single number.</li>
  <li>If $\alpha$ is purely real, then we can simplify the expression to be $z^\alpha = |z|^\alpha e^{i\alpha[\Arg z + 2\pi n]}$, so that $z^\alpha$ forms a set whose magnitude is always the same for every $n$, but whose phase rotates around the circle of radius $|z|^\alpha$.</li>
  <li>If $\alpha = \beta i$ is purely imaginary, then we can simplify the expression to be $z^\alpha = |z|e^{-\beta[\Arg(z) + 2\pi n]}e^{i\beta\ln |z|}$, so that $z^\alpha$ forms a set whose phase is the same for every $n$, but whose magnitude is always on a ray of angle $\beta\ln|z|$.</li>
</ol>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> The <i>principal value</i> of $z^\alpha$ is defined to be 
$$z^\alpha = e^{\alpha\Log z} = e^{\alpha[\ln|z| + i\Arg(z)]}.$$

<p>In our discussion of the logarithm and its multivalued nature, we defined the principal value as a particular one of these multiple values. We could have defined the principal value as a different one of the multiple values! This leads us to the definition of a <em>branch</em>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $f(z)$ be a multivalued function in a domain $D$. Then, $F(z)$ is said to be a <i>branch</i> of $f(z)$ if the following conditions hold:
<ul>
<li> $F(z)$ is single-valued in $D$ </li>
<li> $F(z)$ is continuous in $D$ </li>
<li> $F(z)$ is one of the values of $f(z)$ </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $f(z)$ be a multivalued function. Then, $z_\*$ is said to be a <i>branch point</i> of $f$ if, for every circle enclosing $z_\*$, $f(z)$ changes discontinuously. 
</div>

<p>To actually construct a branch of a function, we have to draw a curve going outward from the branch point, which allows us to ensure the branch is single valued. In order to get a thorough understanding of the topic, one needs to consider Riemann surfaces, which are outside the scope of the course.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Let $f(z) = \log z$ be the multivalued logarithm. 

&lt;/div&gt;

<b>Definition:</b> A <i>branch cut</i> of a multivalued function $f$ is a curve across which $f$ is discontinuous.
