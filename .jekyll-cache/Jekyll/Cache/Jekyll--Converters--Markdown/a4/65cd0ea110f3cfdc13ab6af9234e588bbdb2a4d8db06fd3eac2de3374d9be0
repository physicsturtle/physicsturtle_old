I"N<p>We consider a system and construct the conservation of energy. In a physical system, there are different ways to add energy to it. The energy $E$ in a system does not have a general formula. However, we can find a formula for the change in energy in a system due to changes in thermodynamic quantities. The change in energy is</p>
