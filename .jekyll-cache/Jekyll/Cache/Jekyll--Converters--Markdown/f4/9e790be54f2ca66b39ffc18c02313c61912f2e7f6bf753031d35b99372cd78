<p>The summation of series has been studied for many years, with several famous results having been derived in many different ways. For example, you may have seen</p>

\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6},\]

<p>which was first derived by Euler (check this!). We will study how to sum results of that form (check this!) and others through the use of complex analysis.</p>
