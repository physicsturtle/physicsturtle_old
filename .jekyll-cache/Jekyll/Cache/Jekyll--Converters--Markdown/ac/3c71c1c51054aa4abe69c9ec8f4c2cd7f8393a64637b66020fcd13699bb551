<p>When one considers a system $\dot{x} = f(x)$, it is possible that there are some parameters in $f$. For example, in $f(x) = r - x^3 + x$, $r$ is a parameter. In a situation like this we change our notation and append an $r$: $\dot{x} = f(x,r)$. Depending on these parameters, the system could have different numbers of fixed points $x_*$. A cubic like $r - x^3 + ax$ could have one, two, or three real roots, depending on the values of the coefficients. One can plot the set of roots as a function of $r$, which will be a few curves in the $r,x_*$ plane. These curves may join up at a particular value of $r$, and when two of these curves join together, it is called a <em>bifurcation</em>. Our goal is to give examples of bifurcations and classify them.</p>

<h3 id="saddle-node-bifurcation">Saddle Node Bifurcation</h3>
<p>A <em>saddle node bifurcation</em>, also called a <em>fold bifurcation</em>, is characterised by having two distinct equilibrium points (i.e. solutions to $f(x) = 0$) for certain values of $r$, but as $r$ is varied, this becomes zero equilibrium points. An example of this is the equation $\dot{x} = x^2 - r$. Thus, $f(x,r) = x^2 - r$ has two solutions if $r &gt; 0$, but no solutions if $r &lt; 0$ (we are interested only in real solutions to $f(x,r) = 0$, recall). The solutions are, for nonnegative $r$, $x = \pm\sqrt{r}$.</p>

<h3 id="transcritical-bifurcation">Transcritical Bifurcation</h3>
<p>A <em>transcritical bifurcation</em> is when there are multiple solutions to $f(x,r) = 0$, and as $r$ is varied, the number of fixed points does not change, but the stabilities of the fixed points do change.</p>

<h3 id="pitchfork-bifurcation">Pitchfork Bifurcation</h3>
<p>A <em>pitchfork bifurcation</em> is when there are already solutions, but solutions are added at a certain value of $r$.</p>
