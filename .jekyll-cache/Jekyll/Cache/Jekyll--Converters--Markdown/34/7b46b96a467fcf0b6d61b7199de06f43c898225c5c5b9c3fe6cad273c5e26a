I"Ô<p>Unit 1 lays out the foundations for understanding how to work with objects in 3 dimensional space. There wonâ€™t be any calculus yet, but weâ€™ll try and understand how to draw pictures, including vectors and graphs. This will be one of the most important skills throughout the rest of the course to intuitively understand the mathematics through graphical means.</p>
