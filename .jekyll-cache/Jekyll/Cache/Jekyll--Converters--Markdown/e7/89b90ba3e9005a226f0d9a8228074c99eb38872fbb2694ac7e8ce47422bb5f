I"W	<p>Suppose we have a function $f(x)$, and we are interested in approximating its value near $x = a$. A truly awful approximation would be $f(x)\approx f(a)$. This is an awful approximation because it works only at the value $x = a$. Everywhere else, the approximation, which is simply a horizontal line, isn’t even close to the value of the actual function.</p>

<p>(insert figure here)</p>

<p>A better approximation would be a straight line which not only passes through the point $(a,f(a))$, but also has the same slope as the original function at that point. This approximation is the linear approximation which we have discussed before:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \approx f(a) + (x-a)f'(a)\approx f(x).</script>

<p>(insert figure here)</p>

<p>One can see that this approximation not only passes through the curve at $(a,f(a))$, but also is pretty close to the curve in a small neighbourhood around $x=a$.</p>

<p>The next best approximation would match the second derivative as well. This approximation is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \approx f(a) + (x-a)f'(a) + \frac{(x-a)^2f''(a)}{2}.</script>

<p>Let’s proceed to one order higher before generalizing this result.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \approx f(a) + (x-a)f'(a) + \frac{(x-a)^2f''(a)}{2} + \frac{(x-a)^3f'''(a)}{6}.</script>

<p>The pattern here should be come clear. Rewriting it in the following form and recalling that $0! = 1$,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \approx \frac{(x-a)^0 f(a)}{0!} + \frac{(x-a)^1f'(a)}{1!} + \frac{(x-a)^2f''(a)}{2} + \frac{(x-a)^3f'''(a)}{6}.</script>

<p>The formula for the $n$ Taylor polynomial to $f$ centred about $x-a$ is therefore</p>

<div class="result">
<b>Result:</b> Suppose $f(x)$ is a function which is differentiable $n$ times at $x=a$. Then, its $n$th degree Taylor polynomial about $x = a$ is given by 
$$T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(x-a)^k f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}.$$
The higher $n$ is, the better $T$ approximates $f$.
