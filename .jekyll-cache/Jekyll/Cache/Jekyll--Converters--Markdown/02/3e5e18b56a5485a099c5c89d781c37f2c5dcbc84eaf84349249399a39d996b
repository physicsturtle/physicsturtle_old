I"Ú<p>Degenerate perturbation theory concerns itself with the problem of finding the corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr√∂dinger equation in the case where some of the eigenvalues are degenerate. We will only treat the case of two-fold degeneracy in this course. If you want to learn about worse cases, please see a more advanced course on quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Consider the Schr√∂dinger equation for an unperturbed Hamiltonian</p>

\[\hat{H}^0\left\|\psi^0_n\right&gt; = E_n\left\|\psi^0_n\right&gt;\]

<h3 id="two-fold-degeneracy">Two-Fold Degeneracy</h3>
<p>Consider two states $\left|\psi^0_n\right&gt;$ and $\left|\phi^0_n\right&gt;$ which both have the same eigenvalue with the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^0$.</p>
