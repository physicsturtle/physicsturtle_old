I"ë<p>Consider solving the equation</p>

\[au_x + bu_y = 0\]

<p>where $u = u(x,y)$ is a differentiable function, and $a$ and $b$ are real constants. This is equivalent to</p>

\[(a,b)\cdot(u_x,u_y) = (a,b)\cdot\nabla u = 0\]

<p>If we divide by the constant $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, this can be expressed in terms of a directional derivative.</p>

\[\frac{(a,b)}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\cdot\nabla u = 0\]

<p>This gives us the following geometric interpretation:</p>
