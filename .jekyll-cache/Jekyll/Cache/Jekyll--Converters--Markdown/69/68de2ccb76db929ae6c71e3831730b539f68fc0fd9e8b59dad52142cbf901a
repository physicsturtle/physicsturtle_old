I""<p>The gradient vector of a function is the analogue of the normal derivative from single variable calculus. It encodes information about which direction the function increases in. The gradient vector is defined as</p>

\[\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\hat{\textbf{x}} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\hat{\textbf{y}}\]

<h3 id="geometric-interpretation">Geometric Interpretation</h3>
<p>Consider the function \(f\) evaluated on a curve \(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t))\). How does \(f\) change along this curve? If we differentiate with respect to \(t\), we can find how fast \(f\) changes along the curve. This is given by</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
f'(t) &amp;=&amp; f_x(x,y) x'(t) + f_y(x,y) y'(t)\\
&amp;=&amp; \nabla f\cdot \textbf{r}'(t) \\
&amp;=&amp; |\nabla f||\textbf{r}'(t)|\cos\theta
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>Suppose the curve \(\textbf{r}(t)\) is a level curve of \(f\). This would mean that \(f’(t)\) is zero along this curve. If neither \(\nabla f\) nor \(\textbf{r}’(t)\) are zero, then this means that \(\cos\theta = 0\), so \(\theta = \pi/2\). If instead we want to know the direction of greatest increase, we can consider a curve parallel to the gradient vector. This makes \(\cos\theta = 1\), which is then the maximum value of \(f’(t)\). Thus the gradient vector points in the direction of <em>fastest increase</em> of the function \(f\). In summary, the gradient vector is always <em>perpendicular</em> to level sets of the function.</p>
