I"¾<p>It is possible to solve ODEs with the Fourier transform by finding integral representation for their solution. Many of these integrals cannot be evaluated as elementary functions, but integral representations are useful for other things. For example, one can derive asymptotic formulas for certain special functions, which may be difficult with only a Taylor series representation. We will start by recalling the following useful formula:</p>
