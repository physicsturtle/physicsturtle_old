I"(<p>In this section, we consider composite systems. A composite system is a quantum system which is formed out of two or more other quantum systems. A composite quantum system can have one or more particles. An example of a composite quantum system of only one particle could be an electron in the hydrogen atom. Normally, we think of the orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum as separate quantum systems. It is possible to <em>put them together</em> by considering them as a composite quantum system. The only types of composite quantum system that we will consider in this course are systems that contain one or two particles. In later courses, we will consider much more complicated composite systems, as well as revisit the ones we are seeing in this course from a more formal viewpoint.</p>
