<p>Triple integrals are, in general, more difficult to visualize geometrically, because we would need four dimensions! There are however many physical applications that make the concept of a triple integral very transparent. Let us consider a function</p>

\[f : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R},\]

<p>and suppose that we are interested in integrating it over a region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$.</p>
