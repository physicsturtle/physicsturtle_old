I"r<p>Degenerate perturbation theory concerns itself with the problem of finding the corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr√∂dinger equation in the case where some of the eigenvalues are degenerate. We will start with the case of two-fold degeneracy, and then proceed later to worse cases.</p>
