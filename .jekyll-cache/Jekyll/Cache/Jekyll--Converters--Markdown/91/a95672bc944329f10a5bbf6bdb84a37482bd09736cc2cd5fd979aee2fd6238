<p>In this short document we will be addressing the summation of Fourier Series. That is, given a series of the form
[\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left(a_n\cos(nx) + b_n\sin(nx)\right)]
can we find a function $f(x)$ that this series came from? If the series is convergent, then we can take the partial sums and find what function they converge to. However, if one has a function, and calculates its Fourier series, it is possible that this series may not converge, in which case we have to employ different methods of finding its sum.</p>
