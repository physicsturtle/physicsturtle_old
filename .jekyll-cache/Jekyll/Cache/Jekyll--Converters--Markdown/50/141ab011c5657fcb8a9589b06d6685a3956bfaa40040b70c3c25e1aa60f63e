I"<p>We begin with the notion of electric charge. The fundamental unit of charge is the electron. The SI unit for charge is the coulomb C. The charge on one electron is (e = 1.6\times 10^{-19}) C. We take as a convention (e) to be the \textit{positive} unit of charge. That is to say, the charge on the electron is (-e), and the charge on the proton is (+e). It is not possible to have a charge that is \textit{not} an integer multiple of (e). This charge is so important that we call (e) the \textit{elementary charge}. It appears all over electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and other areas of physics. For those of you who are interested in particle physics, you may scream out that a quark can have a charge that is not an integer multiple of $e$. This is beyond the scope of this course.</p>

<p>All atoms are neutral; they have net  charge 0. This is because they have the same number of protons and neutrons. This means that matter is also neutral. When we draw charges, we usually draw them as circles with the value of the charge on them, whether that value be a number or a variable. From your daily experience so far in life, you will have seen many examples of charged objects. A charged object is simply one where there are an unequal amount of electrons and protons. Since the protons always stay put, an excess of electrons or a lack of electrons will produce a negatively charged or positively charged object, respectively.</p>

<p>Two objects with opposite charges will attract one another, and two objects with like charges will repel one another. What is not obvious, but is nevertheless true, is that a charged object, of either polarity, will attract an uncharged object. This is due to the electrons in the material moving around differently due to the influence of the other charge.</p>
