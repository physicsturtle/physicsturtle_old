I"ù<p>The first law of thermodynamics is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">dU = TdS - PdV + \mu dN.</script>

<p>In general, if one has a function $f(x,y)$ of two variables, $x$ and $y$, its differential is</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>$$df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\bigg</td>
      <td>_ydx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\bigg_x dy</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>where the subscripts on the partial derivatives are written to make clear which variables are being held constant. This tells us three things about the internal energy $U$.</p>

<p>1 $U$ is a function of $S$ and $V$.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2 $\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\bigg</td>
      <td>_{V,N} = T$.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3 $\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\bigg</td>
      <td>_{S,N} = -P$.</td>
    </tr>

<p>4 $\frac{\partial U}{\partial N}\bigg_{S,V} = \mu$.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Calclulate the temperature of the system with internal energy and thereby express the internal energy in terms of temperature. $C$ is a constant. 
$$U = C\left(\frac{e^{S/nR}}{V}\right)^{2/3}$$ </p>
The temperature is given by 
$$T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\bigg_V = \frac{2}{3}\frac{C}{nR}\left(\frac{e^{S/nR}}{V}\right)^{2/3} = \frac{2U}{3nR}$$
Thus, the internal energy in terms of temperature is 
$$U = \frac{3nRT}{2}$$
