I"<p>Hello and welcome to a first course in electricity and magnetism! Affectionately known as E&amp;M or “emag, this course is designed for first year undergraduate students of physical sciences or engineering. This subject is a personal favourite of mine, and I’m very excited to be sharing it with you all. I think the reason that I like it so much is that it is such a clean theory and has many interesting problems that can be solved analytically, which is always fun for the mathematically inclined student.</p>
