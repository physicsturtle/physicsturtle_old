<p>This section is outside the scope of this course, whose main purpose is to teach the student how to perform calculations in calculus. This section has the flavour of more rigorous mathematics, namely analysis. You may have heard of this topic as the “epsilon-delta definition of a limit”. This is what we will explore presently.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $f$ be a function. We say that
$$\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$$
if, for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists $\delta &gt; 0$ such that if $|x-a| &lt; \delta$, $|f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon$. 
</div>

<p>When I first heard this definition, I had a very difficult time understanding it. I think that only repetition made me internalize it and begin to understand what it means intuitively. I will show you here what it means intuitively, and I encourage you to mull over this definition many times in order intuitively understand it.</p>

<div class="example">
<b>Example:</b> Prove that the limit of $f(x) = x$ is $a$ as $x$ approaches $a$. 
<b>Solution:</b> write it here
</div>
