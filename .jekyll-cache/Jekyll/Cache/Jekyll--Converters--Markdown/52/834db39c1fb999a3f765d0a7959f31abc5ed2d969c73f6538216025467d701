I"Ù<p>Things you should understand after completing this lesson.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definition of a surface integral</li>
  <li>Surface of a graph</li>
  <li>Parametrized surface</li>
  <li>Flux through a surface â€“ integration of a vector field</li>
  <li>mass of a surface â€“ integration of a scalar field</li>
</ul>

<p>We have already looked at how to calculate integrals of functions over regions of the \(xy\) plane. That was an integral over a <em>flat</em> region. Here, the concept of a surface integral allows us to calculate integrals of functions over a curvy surface!</p>

<p>We can break surface integral problems into 4 different types. They are all solved the same way, but they all have different physical/geometric interpretations as to what they mean.</p>
