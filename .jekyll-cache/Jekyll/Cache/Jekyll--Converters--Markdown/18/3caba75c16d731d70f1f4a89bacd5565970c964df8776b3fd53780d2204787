I"><p>Here we will discuss how we can calculate with mirrors. There are two important equations:</p>

\[\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} =  \frac{1}{f}\]

<p>where $f$ is the focal length. We need to take into account sign here.</p>

<p>We also have the magnification equation:</p>

\[m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}\]

<p>these come with the following sign conventions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$f$ is positive for a concave mirror and negative for a convex mirror</li>
  <li>$m$ is positive for an upright image and negative for an inverted image</li>
  <li>$d_i$ is positive for an image in front of the mirror (real image) and negative for an object behind a mirror (virtual image)</li>
  <li>$d_o$ is positive for an object in front of the mirror (real object) and negative for an object behind a mirror (virtual object)</li>
</ol>
