I"`<p>In this section, we discuss the concept of normalization of a wavefunction. This allows us to make the idea of the squared magnitude of the wave function consistent with the interpretation of it as a probability density function. T</p>

<p>In the field of probability, we define a <em>probability density function</em> $\rho = \rho(x)$. This probability density function has units of $1/x$, whatever $x$ is. In quantum mechanics, $x$ will be position, so $\rho$ will have units of reciprocal length. This means that the probability $P$ of finding a particle between $x$ and $x+dx$ is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x,x+dx) = \rho(x)dx.</script>

<p>Since we know that the particle is always somewhere, it has probability 1 of existing. This means that the condition</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho(x)dx</script>

<p>must hold if this is to make any sense. If you solve the Schrödinger equation, you might not always come up with a normalized wave function; the Schrödinger equation is linear and if $\psi$ is any solution, then $\lambda\psi$ is also a solution.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Normalize the wave function 
$$\psi(x) = \frac{A}{1+x^2}$$
by finding the value of $A$. 

&lt;/div&gt;

You may have noticed in the previous example that if one multiplies $\psi$ by any number whose magnitude is 1, for example $e^{i\phi}$, then the normalization condition still holds. This means that we aren't uniquely specifying a wave function! This concept is not important in this course, but we will revisit it in quantum mechanics II.
