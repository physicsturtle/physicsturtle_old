I"r<p>Hey everyone! Welcome to Classical Mechanics IV. This course extends the ideas of the previous course to further formulations of classical mechanics, for example Hamiltonian mechanics. The course will also introduce the reader to further topics such as the canonical formulation of classical mechanics, continuum mechanics, chaos theory, and perturbation theory.</p>
