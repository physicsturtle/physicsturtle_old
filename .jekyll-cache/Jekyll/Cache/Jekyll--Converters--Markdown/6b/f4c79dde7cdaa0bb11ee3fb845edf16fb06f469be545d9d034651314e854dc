<p>In this section, we will introduce the idea of a Fourier series. A Fourier series is a way of representing a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. It is also useful for representing a non-periodic function, as long as it is on a finite interval; any non-periodic function can be made periodic outside the domain of definition by repeating it. All of the terms I have just used will be made more precise, and examples given.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

<div class="definition">
A <i> Fourier series </i> is a series of the form
$$f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1} a_n\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) + b_n\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)$$
where $2L$ is the period of the function we're representing, and the coefficients $a_0,a_n,b_n$ are constants.

<h3 id="how-to-calculate-a-fourier-series">How to calculate a fourier series</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to expand $f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a function of period $2L$, i.e. $f(x+2L) = f(x)$.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Consider the function $f(x) = 1+x^2$ defined on $[0,1]$. It can be periodically extended to the interval $[-1,1]$, either as an even extension or an odd extension.</p>
