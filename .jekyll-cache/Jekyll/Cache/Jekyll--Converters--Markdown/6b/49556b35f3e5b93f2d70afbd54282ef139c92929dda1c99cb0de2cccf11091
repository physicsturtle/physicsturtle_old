I"<p>We begin with the notion of electric charge. The fundamental unit of charge is the electron. The SI unit for charge is the coulomb C. The charge on one electron is (e = 1.6\times 10^{-19}) C. We take as a convention (e) to be the \textit{positive} unit of charge. That is to say, the charge on the electron is (-e), and the charge on the proton is (+e). It is not possible to have a charge that is \textit{not} an integer multiple of (e). This charge is so important that we call (e) the \textit{elementary charge}. It appears all over electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and other areas of physics. For those of you who are interested in particle physics, you may scream out that a quark can have a charge that is not an integer multiple of $e$. This is beyond the scope of this course.</p>
