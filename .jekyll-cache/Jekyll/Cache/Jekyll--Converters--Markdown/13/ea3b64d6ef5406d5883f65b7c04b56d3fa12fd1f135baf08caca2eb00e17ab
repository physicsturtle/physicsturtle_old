I"ˆ<p>In this section we finally discuss the definition of the derivative, the central object in differential calculus. We consider the problem of finding the slope of the function $f$ at some point $(x,f(x))$. We consider both the point $(x,f(x))$ and a point closeby, $(x+h,f(x+h))$, and draw a line between them. This line is known as a secant line. The slope between these two points is</p>
