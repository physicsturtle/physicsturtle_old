Definition: Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and $E\subset X$, and $\{G_\alpha\}$ be a collection of open subsets of $X$. Then, we say that $\{G_\alpha\}$ is an <i>open cover</i> of $E$ if 
$$E\subset \bigcup_\alpha G_\alpha$$

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and $E\subset X$. We say that $E$ is <i>compact</i> if every open cover of $E$ contains a finite subcover.
</div>

<p>Now for some useful theorems on compactness.</p>

<p>Theorem: Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. If $E\subset X$ is compact, then it is closed.</p>

<p>Proof: Suppose $E\subset X$ is compact. In order to prove that $E$ is closed, letâ€™s prove that $E^c$ is open.</p>

<p>Theorem: If ${K_\alpha}$ is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space $X$ such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of ${K_\alpha}$ is nonempty, then $\cap K_\alpha$ is nonempty.</p>

<p>Theorem: If $E$ is an infinite subset of a compact set $K$, then $E$ has a limit point in $K$.</p>
