I"<p>Degenerate perturbation theory concerns itself with the problem of finding the corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr√∂dinger equation in the case where some of the eigenvalues are degenerate. We will only treat the case of two-fold degeneracy in this course. If you want to learn about worse cases, please see a more advanced course on quantum mechanics.</p>
