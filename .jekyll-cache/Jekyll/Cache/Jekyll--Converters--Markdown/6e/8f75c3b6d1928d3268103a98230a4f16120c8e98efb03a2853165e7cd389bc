I"]<p>In single variable calculus, we were interested in finding the minima and maxima of a function, and this was done by looking at where the derivative is zero. An analogous procedure will be done here.</p>

<h4 id="first-derivative-test">First Derivative Test</h4>
<p>The first derivative test in single variable calculus told us where the tangent line had slope zero, and thus, where the minima and maxima were. Here, taking the gradient of a function, or, all the partial derivatives, will tell us where the <em>tangent plane</em> has zero slope in all directions.</p>
