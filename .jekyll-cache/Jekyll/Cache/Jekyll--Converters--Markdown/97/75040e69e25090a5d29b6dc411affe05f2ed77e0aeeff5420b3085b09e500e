I"©<p>In this section, we will outline another method for calculating band structures. As per its name, it assumes that electrons primarily experience the potential due to atoms in the lattice, and the perturbation is the effect of neighbouring atoms. This can be constrasted with the nearly free electron model, in which the electrons were primarily free, and the perturbation was the effect of a small periodic potential.</p>
