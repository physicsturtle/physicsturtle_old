I"e<p>In this section we examine Rutherford scattering. Rutherford scattering is the situation when a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ is incident with impact parameter $b$ on the Coulomb potential</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">V(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}.</script>

<p>We wish to know the behaviour of the particle as after a long time. We do not care about the region where the particle is close to the potential, but rather its asymptotic behaviour when it is far away. Newtonâ€™s second law for the system is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F(\x) = m\frac{d^2\x}{dt^2}</script>
