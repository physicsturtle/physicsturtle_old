<p>In this section, we will discuss limits at infinity. If a limit at infinity exists, it is said to be a horizontal asymptote. The idea of an asymptote can be applied to approximate a function $f(x)$ for large values of $x$, which is useful for approximately solving problems which would otherwise be very difficult/impossible. The idea of a horizontal asymptote is also useful for showing the long time behaviour of physical systems for instance; one might ask how a mass-spring-damper system behaves at a long time after a force is applied to it.</p>
