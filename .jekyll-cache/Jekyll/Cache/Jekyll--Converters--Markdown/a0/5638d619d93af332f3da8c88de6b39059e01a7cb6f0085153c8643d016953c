I"<p>In this section, we will discuss how to evaluate trigonometric integrals, or, integrals involving just trigonometric functions. There are a few broad categories that these integral fit in to; some are easy and some are hard. In this section, $m$ and $n$ will be integers. Note that no matter what $n$ is, $2n+1$ is always an odd integer! Thus, if we want to say “sine raised to an odd power”, we could write $\sin^{2n+1}x$. If want to say “sine raised to an even power”, we could write $\sin^{2n}x$.</p>
