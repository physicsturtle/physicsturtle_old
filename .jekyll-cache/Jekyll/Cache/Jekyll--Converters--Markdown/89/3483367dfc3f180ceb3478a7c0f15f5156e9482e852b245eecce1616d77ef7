I"q<p>Welcome to Quantum Mechanics III, or, a first course in graduate quantum mechanics. A lot of the same topics as were covered in undergraduate quantum mechanics will be covered, but with a greater level of abstraction and rigour; it is expected that the reader can make the ideas concrete by relating them to example systems from undergraduate quantum mechanics.</p>
