I"ê<p>Consider the equation</p>

\[x^2 + \epsilon x - 1 = 0\]

<p>where $\epsilon \ll 1$ is a small parameter. The $\epsilon x$  term is a perturbation to the equation $x^2 - 1 = 0$. We are interested in finding a solution in terms of $\epsilon$ to this equation. Because it is quadratic, this is simple to do via the quadratic formula:</p>

\[x = -\frac{\epsilon}{2} \pm \sqrt{1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{4}}\]

<p>In many cases, we wonâ€™t be able to solve exactly, but because we have the exact solution, we can compare the perturbation solutions to see how accurate they are. First, letâ€™s expand the exact solution in terms of a Taylor series:</p>

\[\left\{\begin{align}
x = 1  - \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon^2}{8} + 
\end{align}
\right.\]
