I"k<p>Consider the equation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + \epsilon x - 1 = 0</script>

<p>where $\epsilon \ll 1$ is a small parameter. The $\epsilon x$  term is a perturbation to the equation $x^2 - 1 = 0$. We are interested in finding a solution in terms of $\epsilon$ to this equation. Because it is quadratic, this is simple to do via the quadratic formula:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = -\frac{\epsilon}{2} \pm \sqrt{1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{4}}</script>

<p>In many cases, we won’t be able to solve exactly, but because we have the exact solution, we can compare the perturbation solutions to see how accurate they are. First, let’s expand the exact solution in terms of a Taylor series:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left\{\begin{align}
x = 1  - \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon^2}{8} + 
\end{align}
\right.</script>
