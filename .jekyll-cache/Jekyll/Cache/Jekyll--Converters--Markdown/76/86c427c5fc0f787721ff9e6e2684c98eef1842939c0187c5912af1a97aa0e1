I"W<p>In both classical and quantum physics, a rigid rotor is a 3-dimensional rotating system. For example, a top, a figure skater, a water molecule are all examples of rigid rotors. To describe such a system classically, one can solve Newtonâ€™s equation for a rigid body or solve the Euler-Lagrange equations. In quantum mechanics, we are generally concerned with rigid rotors that have certain symmetries. In this course, the only rigid rotor that we will consider is the two body rotor. The hydrogen molecule falls under this category, and the bodies are the proton (nucleus) and the electron.</p>
