    <p>In single variable calculus, we had functions of the form \(y = f(x)\), with a single variable depending on a single variable. In the last unit, we had functions of the form \(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\), which was multiple variables \((x,y,z\)) depending on a single variable, \(t\). Here, we will be looking at functions which depend on multiple variables, for example \(z = f(x,y)\), or \(u = f(x,y,z)\).</p>
