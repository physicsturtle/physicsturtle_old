I"³<p>Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles of the edges of an opening.</p>

<p>Huygenâ€™s principle says that every point on a wave-front acts as a source of tine wavelets that move forward with the same speed as the wave, and the new wavefrtont is the surface that is tangent to the wavelets.</p>

<p>The amount by which waves are diffracted around the edges of an opening is determined by the ratio of the wavelength of the wave to the width of the opening.</p>

\[\theta = \frac{\lambda}{W}\]

<p>The wavelength of light is very short. This means that the diffraction angle $\theta$ is very small, and this is why we can hear around corners, but not see around corners.</p>
