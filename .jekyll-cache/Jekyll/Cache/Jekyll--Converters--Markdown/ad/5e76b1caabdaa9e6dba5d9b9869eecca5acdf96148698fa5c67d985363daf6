<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>We are all familiar with curves in the plane. For example $y = x^2$ is a curve in the 2D plane. That curve also has the property of passing the vertical line test (criteria of being a function). Today we will consider more general curves which do not need to pass the vertical line test, as well as 3 dimensional curves in space. We will discuss different ways of representing curves mathematically and introduce methods for studying these curves.</p>

<p>Often in single variable calculus, we had functions of the form \(y = f(x\); a single variable input and single variable output. Something else could write is \(x = f(t)\), where, physically, this means the position \(x\) of a particle as a function of the time \(t\).</p>

<p>It is often more interesting to consider a particle moving in 2 or 3 dimensions. Letâ€™s consider a function \(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t))\), or \(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\), describing the <em>vector valued</em> position of a particle in 2 or 3 dimensions. These functions trace out a curve in 2 or 3 dimensions as time is increased.</p>

<p>Since parametric equations are just vector valued functions, they can be added and subtracted and multiplied by scalars. The dot or cross product can also be taken between two vector valued functions. Similarly with the magnitude.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<div class="definition"> <b>Definition</b>: A <i>plane curve</i> is a function $\textbf{r} : I \to \mathbb{R}^2$, where $I = (a,b)$ is some open interval in $\mathbb{R}$. It is possible also that $I = \mathbb{R}$. </div>

<p>Now we present an almost identical definition, the only difference being the range of the function.</p>

<div class="definition"> <b>Definition</b>: A <i>space curve</i> is a function $\textbf{r} : I \to \mathbb{R}^3$, where $I = (a,b)$ is some open interval in $\mathbb{R}$. It is possible also that $I = \mathbb{R}$. </div>
