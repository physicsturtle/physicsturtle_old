I"1<p>Calculating residues in complex analysis is very useful for a variety of applications, from purely mathematical purposes to integrals from physics. Here letâ€™s discuss a few tricks.</p>

<p>We expand a function \(f : \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) in a Laurent series</p>

\[f(z) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} a_n(z-z_0)^n\]

<p>the coefficient \(a_{-1}\) is known as the <em>residue of \(f\) at \(z_0\)</em>.</p>

\[\text{Res}(f,z_0) = a_{-1}\]

<p>Depending on what kind of pole \(z_0\) is, there are different tricks for calculating the residue.</p>

<p>If \(z_0\) is a simple pole (pole of order 1), then</p>

\[\text{Res}(f,z_0) = \lim_{z\to z_0}f(z)(z-z_0)\]

<p>If \(z_0\) is a pole of order \(k\), then</p>

\[\text{Res}(f,z_0) = \frac{1}{(k-1)!}\left.\frac{d^{k-1}}{dz^{k-1}} f(z)(z-z_0)^{k}\right|_{z=z_0}\]
