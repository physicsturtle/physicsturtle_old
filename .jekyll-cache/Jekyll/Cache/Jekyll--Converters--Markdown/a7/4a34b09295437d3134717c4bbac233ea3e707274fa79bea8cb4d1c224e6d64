<p>In this section, we will introduce the idea of the limit of a function. This is best done via a picture. Consider the following plot of $y = f(x)$, particularly about the point $x = 1$. What happens to the value of $y$ as we approach $x = 1$ from the left? Well, the value of $y$ gets closer and closer to $2$. How about if we approach from the right? In this case, the value of $y$ gets closer and closer to 1. At exactly the point $x = 1$, we have $y = 2$.</p>

<p>To write this mathematically, we would say</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x) = 2,\qquad \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x) = 1.</script>

<p>These are read, respectively, as ‚Äúthe limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 1 from the left is 2‚Äù and ‚Äúthe limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 1 from the right is 1‚Äù. So, $x\to 1^-$ means $x$ approaches from the left, and $x\to 1^+$ means that $x$ approaches from the right. We would say that <em>the limit does not exist</em>, because it is different from both sides.</p>

<p>For certain functions, it is obvious what the value of the function $f(x)$ approaches as $x$ approaches a certain number.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b> Example: </b> What is the limit of $f(x) = x+2$ as $x$ approaches $-1$? </p>
<b>Solution:</b> In this case, it is quite clear that $f(x)$ approaches $1$. This can be seen readily by graphing the function.
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>For other functions, it is not immediately obvious what the function approaches! Consider the following example.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b> Example: </b> What is the limit of $f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ as $x$ approaches $1$? </p>
<b>Solution:</b> One can notice that the numerator can be factored
