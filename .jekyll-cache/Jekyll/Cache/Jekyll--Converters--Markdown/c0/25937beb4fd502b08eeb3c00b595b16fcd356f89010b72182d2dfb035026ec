<p>We now want to discuss how to differentiate vector valued functions. The definition of differentiation of vector valued functions is identical to the definition for a single variable.</p>

<p>\[ \textbf{r}’(t) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\textbf{r}(t+h) - \textbf{r}(t)}{h}\]</p>

<p>It can be shown that this derivative exists if and only if all of the <em>components</em> of <script type="math/tex">\textbf{r}</script> have derivatives at \(x(t)\)</p>

<div id="answer" class="answer">
The limit exists if and only if for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\) there exists \(\delta &gt; 0\) for which \(\|\textbf{r}\| \)
</div>

<p>This is done in the obvious way; that is, if \(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\), we define the componentwise differentiation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d\textbf{r}}{dt} = \left(\frac{dx}{dt},\frac{dy}{dt},\frac{dz}{dt}\right).</script>

<p>Geometrically, \(\textbf{r}’(t)\) represents the <em>tangent</em> vector to the curve at the point \(\textbf{r}(t)\). We then define the <em>unit tangent vector</em> as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{\textbf{T}} = \frac{\textbf{r}'(t)}{|\textbf{r}'(t)|}</script>

<p>which encodes only the direction of the tangent vector.</p>

<p>Higher derivatives can be similarly calculated. We will discuss the geometric interpretations of higher derivatives in the following section.</p>

<h3 id="integration">Integration</h3>
<p>Integration for curve is defined componentwise. This is identical to how differentiation is defined. In symbols,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_a^b \textbf{r}(t) dt = \left(\int_a^b x(t) dt, \int_a^b y(t) dt,\int_a^b z(t) dt\right)</script>
