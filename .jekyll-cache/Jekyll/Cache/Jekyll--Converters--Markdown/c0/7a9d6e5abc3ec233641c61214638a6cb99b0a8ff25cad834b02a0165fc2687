I"<p>For one dimensional autonomous systems $xâ€™ = f(x)$, we linearize as follows. If $f(\xi) = 0$, then we can linearize about $\xi$ by Taylor expanding about it. This approximation is $f(x) \approx f(\xi) + (x-\xi)fâ€™(\xi) = (x-\xi)fâ€™(\xi)$. So, in the neighbourhood of $\xi$, the system becomes $xâ€™ \approx (x-\xi)fâ€™(\xi)$, because $f(\xi) = 0$.</p>

<p>Note that we have ignored quadratic and higher order terms in $(x-\xi)$. This is because they are negligbly small compared to the first order term. However, if $fâ€™(\xi) = 0$, then they are not neglibly small at all! In this case, we need to do a nonlinear stability analysis. It is also possible that $fâ€™(\xi)$ does not exist; maybe $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, so $x= 0$ is a fixed point but $fâ€™(0)$ doesnâ€™t exist!</p>
