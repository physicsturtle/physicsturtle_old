I"ö<p>The ideal gas law is a relationship between the quantities of $P$ pressure, $T$ temperature, $V$ volume, and $n$ number of moles, of a gas in a closed system. An ideal gas is one where</p>

<ol>
  <li>the particles have low density; the average space between gas molecules is larger than the size of a molecule</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>The ideal gas law is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">PV = nRT</script>

<p>where $T$ is measured in Kelvin NOT Celsius, and $R$ is the ideal constant: $R = 8.31 J/mol/K$ in SI. It is also sometimes stated as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">PV = NkT</script>

<p>where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $k = 1.381\times 10^{-23} J/K$ in SI, and $k = R/N_A$, where $N_A$ is avogadroâ€™s number.</p>
