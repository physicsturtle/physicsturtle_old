I"“<p>In Lagrangian mechanics, we considered a Lagrangian as a function of $n$ generalized coordinates</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\L(t,q_1,q_2,\dots,q_n, \dot{q}_1,\dot{q}_2,\dots,\dot{q}_n),</script>

<p>and obtained $n$ equations of motion, each of which is a second order ODE:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial\L}{\partial q_i} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial\L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}.</script>

<p>These equations of motion can be solved by specifying $2n$ initial conditions $q_i(0)$ and $\dot{q}_i(0)$. The $n$ generalized coordinates $q_i$ are said to constitute an $n$ dimensional <em>configuration space</em> $Q$.</p>
