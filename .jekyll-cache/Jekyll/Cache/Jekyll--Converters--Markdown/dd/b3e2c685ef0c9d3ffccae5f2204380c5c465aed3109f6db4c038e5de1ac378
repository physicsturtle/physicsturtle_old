    <p>In single variable calculus, we had functions of the form \(y = f(x)\), with a single variable depending on a single variable. In the last unit, we had functions of the form \(\textbf{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\), which was multiple variables \((x,y,z\)) depending on a single variable, \(t\). Here, we will be looking at functions which depend on multiple variables, for example \(z = f(x,y)\), or \(u = f(x,y,z)\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The limits on our abilities to graph functions stops at functions which take <em>two</em> independent variables and output a single dependent variable. Letâ€™s see some practical examples of functions of multiple variables:</p>
