I"Û<p>In this section, we consider integrals with multivalued integrands. By multivalued integrands, we donâ€™t really mean that the original integral itself is multivalued; we will be considering real valued functions which of course have single values. However, when the real variable $x$ is replaced by the complex variable $z$, it causes the integrand to become multivalued, which makes choosing a contour more difficult. This is what we mean by multivalued integrands.</p>
