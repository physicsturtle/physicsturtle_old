<p>Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and $E\subset X$. Then $E$ is closed if all limit points of $E$ are already in $E$.</p>

<p>Define $\overline{E} = E\cup E’$.</p>

<p>Theorems on closed sets:</p>

<p>Theorem: The set $\overline{E}$ is closed.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $x$ be a limit point of $\overline{E}$. Then every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a point $y$ of $\overline{E}$. If this point $y$ is in $E$, then $x$ is a limit point of $E$, so $x\in E’\subset \overline{E}$. If $y\in E’$, then $y$ is a limit point of $E$, and so every ball around it contains a point of $E$.</p>
