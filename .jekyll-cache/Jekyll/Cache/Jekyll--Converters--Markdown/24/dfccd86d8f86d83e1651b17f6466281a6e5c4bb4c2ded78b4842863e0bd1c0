I"&<p>A thin lens has the same equations as the ones for the spherical mirror, but the conventions are different.</p>

\[\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f}\]

<p>and the magnification</p>

\[m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}\]

<ol>
  <li>$f$ is positive for a convex lens, and negative for a concave lens</li>
  <li>$m$ is positive for an upright image relative to the object, and negative for an inverted image relative to the object</li>
  <li>$d_i$ is positive foran image on the side opposite to the object (real image) and negative for an object on the same side as the object (virtual image)</li>
  <li>$d_o$ is positive for an object in front of the surface of the incident ray (real object) and negative for an object behind the surface of the incident ray (virtual object)</li>
</ol>
