I"µ	<p>Definition: Let $S$ be a set. Then an <em>order</em> on $S$ is a relation $&lt;$ on $S$ which satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For every $x,y\in S$, one and only one of the following is true:
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
x < y, \quad x = y,\quad y < x %]]></script></li>
  <li>For $x,y,z\in S$, if $x &lt; y$ and $y &lt; z$, then $x &lt; z$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Examples of orders on $S = \mathbb{N},\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$.</p>

<p>could have $S$ be the words in the English language, where $&lt;$ is the dictionary order. This is known as the lexicographical order.</p>

<p>Let $S$ be a nonempty set. Is $\mathcal{P}(S)$ with the order $A &lt; B$ if $A\subset B$ an order?</p>

<li><div> The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ can be thought of as ordered pairs, $(m,n)$: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{(m,n): m\in\mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$. Define the relation $R$ such that $(m_1,n_1) R (m_2,n_2)$ if $m_1n_2 = m_2n_1$. Show that $R$ is an equivalence relation. </div>
