I"â<p>In this section we finally discuss the definition of the derivative, the central object in differential calculus. We consider the problem of finding the slope of the function $f$ at some point $(x,f(x))$. We consider both the point $(x,f(x))$ and a point closeby, $(x+h,f(x+h))$, and draw a line between them. This line is known as a secant line. The slope between these two points is</p>

\[m = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{x+h - x} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.\]

<p>As $h$ gets closer and closer to 0, the points $(x,f(x))$ and $(x+h,f(x+h))$ gets closer and closer to one another, and $m$ gets closer and closer to being the slope of the tangent line at the point $(x,f(x))$. In fact, if we take the <em>limit</em> of $m$ as $h$ goes to zero of the difference quotient $m$, then we will in fact get the slope at the point $(x,f(x))$. The slope of a function $f$ is called the <em>derivative of $f$</em>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Consider a function $f(x)$. The <i>derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$</i> is the limit
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.$$
If this limit does not exist, then we say that <i>the derivative of $f$ at $x$ does not exist</i>. 
</div>

<p>There is an alternative but equivalent definition of the derivative, which is sometimes more useful.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Consider a function $f(x)$. The <i>derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$</i> at the point $x = a$ is the limit
$$f'(a) = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}.$$
If this limit does not exist, then we say that <i>the derivative of $f$ at $a$ does not exist</i>. 
</div>

<p>We will not yet use the definition of the derivative to actually calculate any derivatives; we will leave that to the next section.</p>
