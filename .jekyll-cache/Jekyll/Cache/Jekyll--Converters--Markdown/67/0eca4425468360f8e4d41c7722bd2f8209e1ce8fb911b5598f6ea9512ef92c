I"Ñ<p>Unit 5 studies the last kind of function between sets of real numbers. That is, functions which take a vector input and give a vector output. In symbols, this is functions like</p>

\[f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\]

<p>we will be considering functions where \(n = m = 2\) or \(n = m = 3\). These kinds of functions are known as <em>vector fields</em>.</p>
