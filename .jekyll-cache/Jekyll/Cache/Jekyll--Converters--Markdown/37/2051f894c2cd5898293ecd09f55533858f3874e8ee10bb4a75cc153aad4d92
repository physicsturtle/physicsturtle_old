I" <p>Suppose we put a gas in a cylinder of length $L$, cross sectional area $A$, and suppose that the cylinder has a piston at one end which is free to move.</p>

<p>(insert picture)</p>

<p>We start with the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$. The pressure on the piston is a result of particles bouncing off the face of the piston. Suppose that this collision is elastic, so the particle does not lose kinetic energy during the collision. The particle comes in with velocity $v_x$ in the $x$ direction, and leaves with velocity $-v_x$. This causes a change in momentum $2mv_x$. If the particle collides minimally with other particles in the system, it will travel all the way to the other end of the system (length $L$), and then back (again length $L$) with time</p>

\[\Delta t = \frac{2L}{v_x}\]

<p>The force on the piston is then the change in momentum divided by change in time:</p>

\[\frac{2mv_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{mv_x^2}{L}\]

<p>Dividing by the cross-sectional area, we get the pressure:</p>

\[P = \frac{mv_x^2}{V}\]

\[v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}\]
