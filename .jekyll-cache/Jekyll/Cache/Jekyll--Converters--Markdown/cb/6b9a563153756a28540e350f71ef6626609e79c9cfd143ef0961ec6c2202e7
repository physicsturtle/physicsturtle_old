I"ƒ<p>\question[$*$] A culture of bacteria in a petri dish grows exponentially from an initial population of 5000 cells. Let $b(t)$ be the the number of bacteria after $t$ hours. Then $b(0) = 5000$. At $t = 10$ hours, scientists remove 4000 cells from the dish. At $t = 20$ hours, there are exactly 12000 cells in the dish. How many cells will be present in the dish at $t = 30$ hours?</p>
