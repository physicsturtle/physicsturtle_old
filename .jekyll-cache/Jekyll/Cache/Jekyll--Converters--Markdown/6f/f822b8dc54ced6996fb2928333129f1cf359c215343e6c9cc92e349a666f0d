<p>There are a few different ways to define a line in three dimensional space.</p>

<h3 id="parametric-form-of-a-line">Parametric Form of a Line</h3>
<p>A parametric equation is not a relationship between the spatial variables, but instead is a function of a <em>parameter</em>, usually $t$ for time, that, as it is increased, traces out the line.</p>

<p>We learned before that we can draw a  vector $\textbf{r}_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)$ pointing from the origin to the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$. If we have the direction $\textbf{v}$ of a line, then we can trace out all the points on the line by starting at the point $\textbf{r}_0$, and then adding vectors of different lengths but in the same direction as $\textbf{v}$. This gives us the parametric equation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textbf{r}(t) = \textbf{r}_0 + \textbf{v}t</script>

<p>This can be visualized by (insert graphic here)</p>

<p>When we define a line like this, $\textbf{r}_0$ is not unique. We could have picked <em>any</em> point on the line!</p>

<h3 id="equation-form-of-a-line">Equation Form of a Line</h3>

<p>I personally don’t like the “equation form” way of defining a line. I find it opaque and cumbersome. Nonetheless, we should know what it is and how to work with it. The equation form of a line is actually <em>two</em> equations. In particular, the equations of two planes. Two planes, if they aren’t parallel, will intersect in a line. This line is the line defined by the equations of the two planes.</p>

<h3 id="switching-between-forms">Switching Between Forms</h3>
<p>One useful skill is switching between the equation form and the parametric form of a line.</p>
