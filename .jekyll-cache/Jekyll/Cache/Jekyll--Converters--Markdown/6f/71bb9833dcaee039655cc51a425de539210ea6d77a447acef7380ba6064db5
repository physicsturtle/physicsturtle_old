\question[$**$] A right circular cylindrical tank of radius 2 m and height 8 m is full of water. Find the work done in pumping the water to the top of the tank. Assume that the density of water is 1000\,\si{kg/m^3}. You may assume that the gravitational field strength is $g = 10\,\si{m/s^2}$.

\begin{solution}[100mm]
The volume of a thin horizontal slice is
\[dV = {2^2}\pi dy = 4\pi dy\]
The mass of a thin horizontal slice is
\[ dm = \rho dV = 4\rho \pi dy\]
The work to raise a thin horizontal slice by a distance $y$ is
\[dW = gydm = 4\rho \pi gydy\]
Then the total work to raise all of the disks is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
W &amp;=&amp; \int_0^8 4\rho \pi gydy  \\
&amp;=&amp; 4\rho \pi g\int_0^8 ydy\\
&amp;=&amp; 4\rho \pi g(32) \\
&amp;=&amp; 128\rho \pi g \\
&amp;=&amp; 1280000\pi\,\si{J}
\end{eqnarray*}

\question[$**$] A uniform 100 ft long cable weighing 5 lb/ft supports a safe weighing 500 lb. Find the work done in winding 80 ft of the cable onto a drum.

\begin{solution}[200mm]
This problem is made easier if we consider the bottom 20 ft of cable as part of the safe, thus forming a $500 + (20)(5) = 600$ lb cable + safe. We will call the work to raise this cable + safe $W_1$. Then $W_1$ can be calculated as 
\[W_1 = 600\times 80 = 48000\,\si{ft\cdot lb}\]
Now consider the work $W_2$ it takes to wind 80 ft of cable onto a drum. The weight of a small length of cable is $5 dy$, and the work it takes to raise this small length a distance of $y$ is $dW_2 =  5ydy$. Then $W_2$ can be calculated as
\[W_2 = \int_0^{80} 5ydy = 16000 \]
Now summing the two parts of wo rk together, we have
\[W_1 + W_2 = W_\text{total} = 64000 \,\si{ft\cdot lb}\]
\end{solution}


\question[$***$] 
\begin{parts}
\part How much work is done in filling an upright cylindrical tank of radius 3 ft and height 10 ft with liquid weighing $w\,\si{lb/ft^3}$ through a hole in the bottom? 
\part How much if the tank is horizontal?
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}[200mm]
\begin{parts}
\part We can think about this problem as lifting slices of water of circular cross section from the bottom of the tank up to some height $y$ inside the tank. The volume of a thin circular slice is 
\[dV = \pi 3^2 dy = 9\pi dy\]
The weight of a thin circular slice is 
\[ d(\text{weight}) = w dV = 9\pi w dy\]
The work to raise a thin circular slice by a distance $y$ is 
\[ dW = y d(\text{weight}) = 9\pi w y dy\]
Thus we can calculate the work by integrating over all slices from $y = 0$ ft to $y = 10$ ft.
\[W = \int_0^{10} 9\pi wydy = 450\pi \,\si{ft\cdot lb}\]

\part We take the same approach as above, however each slice of water that is lifted has a different cross sectional area. It is no longer uniformly circular cross sections like in part (a). Consider rectangular cross sections with dimensions 10 and $2x$. The volume of each cross section will be 
\[dV = Ady = (10)(2x)dy = 20 x dy \]
Then we can calculate the weight of a thin rectangular slice as 
\[d(\text{weight}) = w dV = 20wxdy\] 
The work to raise a thin rectangular sice a distance $y$ is 
\[dW = 20 xyw dy\]
Since we are dealing with cross sections of a cylinder, $x$ and $y$ are related by $x^2 + (y-3)^2 = 3^2$, because $y$ is measured from the very bottom of the cylinder, not from the centre. Thus we can substitute $x$ in terms of $y$ in order to evaluate the integral.
\[W = 20w\int_0^6 y\sqrt {9 - (y - 3)^2} dy \]
To evaluate this integral, let $y -3 = u$. Then we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
W &amp;=&amp; 20 w\int_{-3}^3(u+3)\sqrt{9-u^2} du\\
&amp;=&amp; 20w \int_{-3}^3 u\sqrt{9-u^2}du + 60 w\int_{-3}^3\sqrt{9-u^2} du
\end{eqnarray*}
The first integral is zero because it is an odd function evaluated over a symmetric interval, and the second one can be evaluated geometrically because it is the integral of the graph of a circle. Then we have
\[W = 270w\pi \,\si{ft\cdot lb}\]

\end{parts}
\end{solution}

\question[$**$] A conical vessel is 12 ft across the top and 15 ft deep. If it contains a liquid weighing $w$ lb/ft$^3$ to a depth of 10 ft, find the work done in pumping the liquid to a height 3 ft above the top of the vessel. You may express your answer in terms of $w$.

\begin{solution}[90mm]
The weight of a small disk of thickness $\Delta y$ at height where the radius of the disk is $x$ of the liquid will be $ W = \pi x^2 w \Delta y$. The work required to lift this disk to a height of $y = 18$ will be \[\Delta W = \pi x^2 w (18-y)\Delta y\]
By similar triangles, we have 
\[\frac{x}{y} = \frac{6}{15}\]
This gives us 
\begin{eqnarray*} 
W &amp;=&amp; \int_0^{10} \frac{4}{25}\pi wy^2(18-y) dy \\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{4}{25}\pi w \int^{10}_0 y^2(18-y) dy\\
&amp;=&amp; 560 \pi w \text{ ft}\cdot\text{lb}
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus it takes $560\pi w$ ft $\cdot$ lb to lift all of the liquid to a height of 18 m.
\end{solution}
