I"¶<p>In this section, we will show how to evaluate integrals by the method of stationary phase. Consider the integral</p>

\[I = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{iz\phi(t)} f(t) dt,\qquad z\gg 1.\]

<p>If $z \gg 1$, then if $\phi$ changes by even a little bit, then $z\phi$ changes by a lot, so that there are rapid oscillations in $e^{iz\phi}$. These rapid oscillations cause cancellations in the integral, so, as long as $\phiâ€™(t)$ is not too small, there is a near zero contribution to the integral. Thus, we will only consider the integral in the neighbourhood of $t_*$, where $\phiâ€™(t_*) = 0$. This is where the phase is stationary, hence, <em>stationary phase</em>.</p>

<p>The integral is then approximated by Taylor expanding $\phi$ about $t_*$. The function $f$ is evaluated at the point $t_*$. For ease of notation, define $f_* = f(t_*)$, $\phi_* = \phi(t_*)$, and $\phiâ€™â€˜<em>* = \phiâ€™â€˜(t</em>*)$. The leading order approximation to the integral is thus</p>

\[I \sim \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t_*)e^{iz[\phi(t_*) + (t-t_*)^2\phi''(t_*)/2]} dt\]

<p>If we factor out the terms not depending on $t$, then we are left with a Fresnel type integral. To evaluate it, make the substitution $u = (t-t_*)\sqrt{|z\phiâ€™â€˜_*|/2}$. This gives us</p>

\[I \sim f(t_*) e^{i\phi_*}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{i\sgn(\phi''_*)u^2}\sqrt{\frac{2}{z|\phi''_*|}} du\]

<p>We now rewrite the complex exponential using Eulerâ€™s identity so that we can see the Fresnel integrals.</p>

\[I \sim f(t_*) e^{i\phi_*}\sqrt{\frac{2}{z|\phi''_*|}} \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \cos(u^2) du + \sgn(\phi''_*)\int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin(u^2) du \right)\]

<p>The integrals are famously (show derivation here) each equal to $\sqrt{\pi/2}$,</p>

\[\int_{-\infty}^\infty \cos(u^2) du = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin(u^2) du = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}.\]

<p>This yields the following leading order approximation to the integral.</p>

\[I \sim f(t_*) e^{i\phi_*}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi }{z|\phi''_*|}} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{\sgn(\phi''_*)}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\]

<p>If we rewrite this with complex exponential form, we get a phase shift.</p>

\[I \sim f(t_*) e^{i\phi_* + i\sgn(\phi''_*)\pi/4}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi }{z|\phi''_*|}}.\]
