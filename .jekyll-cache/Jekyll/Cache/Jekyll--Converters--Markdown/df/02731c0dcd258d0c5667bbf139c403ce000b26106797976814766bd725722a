I"S<p>The Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field is</p>

\[\mathscr{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu},\]

<p>where the Faraday tensor $F$ has components defined by</p>

\[F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu.\]

<p>From this, we can calculate an action $S$, which is given by</p>

\[S = \int-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} d^4\textbf{x}.\]

<p>There will be 4 coupled PDEs for this action! Let’s see how calculating the Euler-Lagrange equations for this action can produce Maxwell’s equations.</p>

<p>The Euler-Lagrange equations are (for $\mu = 0,1,2,3$)</p>

\[\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial A_u} - \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial(\partial_n A_\mu)} = 0.\]

<p>There is no explicit dependent on the vector potential $A_\mu$ itself, but rather only on its derivatives.</p>
