I"‚<p>In this section, we will introduce the subject of the calculus of variations and briefly describe the types of problems that we intend to solve with it. The calculus of variations is a field of optimization. You will have seen before two types of optimization in calculus. In your first semester of calculus, we considered functions of the form $y = f(x)$. For these functions, we were able to calculate $fâ€™(x)$ and then set $fâ€™(x) = 0$, then solve for $x$. This value of $x$ is called a <em>stationary point</em> of $f$. In multivariable calculus, we considered functions of the form $u = f(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ (or maybe more variables), then set $\nabla u = 0$ and solved for points $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ such that $\nabla f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = 0$. There, we had multiple variables and had to solve for all of them. The calculus of variations extends this idea to having <em>infinitely</em> many variables; we need to find the values of all of them in order to find the <em>stationary points</em>, whereby a point consists of infinitely many numbers. By infinitely many numbers, we search for a <em>function</em> $x(t)$. Picking a value of $t$ determines a value of $x$; there are infinitely many possible values of $t$ and thus infinitely many corresponding values of $x$. The argument $t$ can be thought of as a continuous analogue of a value of the subscript $x_1,x_2,x_3$ from the multivariable calculus case.</p>
