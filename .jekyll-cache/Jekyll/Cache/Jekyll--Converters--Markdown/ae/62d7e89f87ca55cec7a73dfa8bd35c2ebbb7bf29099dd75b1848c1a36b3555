<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

<p>Torsion and curvature are two quantities that describe geometric properties of a curve. Curvature can be defined for curves in either 2 or 3 dimensions, but has slightly different properties in each, and torsion can only be defined in three dimensions. Letâ€™s begin with the definitions.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b> Definition </b>
Let $\textbf{r}$ be a space curve (range is $\mathbb{R}^3$). Suppose $\textbf{T}$ is the unit tangent vector to $\textbf{r}$. Then, if $s$ is the arc length of $\textbf{r}$, we define the <i>curvature</i> $\kappa$ to be
$$\kappa = \left|\frac{d\textbf{T}}{ds}\right|$$
</div>

<p>Because the curve is not always given parametrized in terms of arc length, and it is not always easy to parametrize in terms of arc length, we can rewrite $\kappa$ in the following way. Assuming that $t$ is a valid change of parameter (i.e. $ds/dt$ is never zero), we get</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}

\kappa &=& \left|\frac{d\textbf{T}}{ds}\right| \\

&=& \left|\frac{d\textbf{T}/dt}{ds/dt}\right| \\

&=&  \frac{|\hat{\textbf{T}}'(t)|}{|\textbf{r}'(t)|}

\end{eqnarray} %]]></script>

<p>Which allows us to calculate the curvature just in terms of derivatives with respect to $t$.</p>

<p>In two dimensions, we can actually define a <em>signed curvature</em>, whereas in three dimensions, curvature can only be nonnegative. In two dimensions, we obtain the following definition.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b> Definition: </b>
 Let $\textbf{r}$ be a plane curve (range is $\mathbb{R}^2$), and suppose $\textbf{T}$ is the unit tangent vector to $\textbf{r}$, and let $\textbf{N}$ be the unit vector rotated $90\degree$ counterclockwise from $\textbf{T}$. Then, 
$$\frac{d\textbf{T}}{ds} = \kappa\textxbf{N}$$
where $\kappa$ is the <i>signed curvature</i>.
</div>

<p>In this case, we have that $\kappa$ can be positive, negative, or zero.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $\textbf{r}$ be a plane or space curve, and suppose $\textbf{T}$ is the unit tangent vector to the curve, and $\kappa$ is the curvature. Then the <i>normal vector</i> $\textbf{N}$ is given by
$$\hat{\textbf{N}} = \frac{1}{\kappa}\frac{d\textbf{T}}{ds}$$
</div>

<p>The normal vector is only well defined if the curvature is nonzero. Next, we define the binormal vector, which only exists in 3 dimensions.</p>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $\hat{\textbf{T}}$ and $\hat{\textbf{N}}$ be the unit tangent and unit normal vectors, respectively. Then, the binormal vector is 
    $$\hat{\textbf{B}} = \hat{\textbf{T}}\times\hat{\textbf{B}}$$
</div>

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> Let $\hat{\textbf{B}}$ be the binormal vector to a curve, and $\hat{\textbf{N}}$ be the normal vector. Then, we define torsion $\tau$ by
    $$\tau = -\frac{d\hat{\textbf{B}}{ds}\cdot\hat{\textbf{N}}$$
</div>

<p>For the definition of torsion, some books define it as $\tau = \frac{d\hat{\textbf{B}}{ds}\cdot\hat{\textbf{N}}$, without the negative. We</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p>After that slough of definitions, I think we need some discussion. First, letâ€™s look at what these things mean geometrically. First, letâ€™s do the two dimensional case.</p>

<p>For the three dimensional case, the picture is a bit more complicated:</p>
