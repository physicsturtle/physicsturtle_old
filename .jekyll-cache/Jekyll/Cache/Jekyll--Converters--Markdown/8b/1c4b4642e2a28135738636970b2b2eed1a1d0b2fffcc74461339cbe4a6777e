I"±<p>The partial derivatives represent the rate of change of a function in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions. It is also possible to calculate the rate of change of a function in any direction in the \(xy\) plane. This is called the directional derivative. Suppose weâ€™re interesting in calculating the derivative of a function \(f(x,y)\) in the direction of the <em>unit vector</em> \(\hat{\textbf{u}}  = (a,b)\). We define this as</p>
