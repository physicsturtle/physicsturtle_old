I"<p>Degenerate perturbation theory concerns itself with the problem of finding the corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation in the case where some of the eigenvalues are degenerate. We will only treat the case of two-fold degeneracy in this course. If you want to learn about worse cases, please see a more advanced course on quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Consider the Schrödinger equation for an unperturbed Hamiltonian</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{H}^0\left\|\psi^0_n\right> = E_n\left\|\psi^0_n\right></script>

<h3 id="two-fold-degeneracy">Two-Fold Degeneracy</h3>
<p>Consider two states $\left|\psi^0_n\right&gt;$ and $\left|\phi^0_n\right&gt;$ which have the same eigenvalue with the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^0$.</p>
