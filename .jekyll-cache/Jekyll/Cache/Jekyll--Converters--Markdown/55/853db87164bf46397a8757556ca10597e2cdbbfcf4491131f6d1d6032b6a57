<p>The curl is an operation which can only be defined in three dimensions.</p>

<h4 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

<p>If we want to define curl in a different coordinate system, such as spherical, can we use the same definition? That is, if \(\textbf{F} = F_r\hat{\textbf{r}} + F_\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}+F_\varphi\hat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}}\), can we say that</p>

\[\nabla\times\textbf{F} = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{\textbf{r}} &amp; \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} &amp; \hat{\boldsymbol{\varphi}} \\  \frac{\partial}{\partial r} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial\varphi} \\ F_r &amp; F_\theta &amp; F_\varphi \end{vmatrix} ?\]

<p>The answer is <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p>Memory trick for the curl: Just remember that the first elmenet is $\partial F_z/\partial y$, and then we get permutations. $z\to y\to x$ and cyclic for the vector component, use logic to determine derivatives and unit vectors</p>
