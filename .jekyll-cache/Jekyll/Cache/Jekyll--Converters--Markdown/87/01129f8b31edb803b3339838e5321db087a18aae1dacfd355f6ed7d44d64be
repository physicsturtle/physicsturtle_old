I"}<p>Column Space:</p>

<p>Column Vector: a matrix having a single column
Complex-Valued Matrix: a matrix that contains one or more elements which is a complex         number or complex valued function
Consistent: a set of simultaneous equations is consistent if it has at least one solution
Constant Matrix: a matrix whose elements are all numbers (no variables)
Elementary Row Operation: operations which can be used to transform a matrix into row echelon     form. They are, switch any two rows, multiply the elements of any row by a nonzero         scalar, and add a scalar multiple of any row to another row</p>

<p>Homogeneous System: a system of equations in which all of the constant terms are zero
Inconsistent: a set of simultaneous equations is inconsistent if it has no solutions</p>

<p>Matrix: a rectangular array of elements arranged in horizontal rows and vertical columns, and are     usually enclosed in brackets
Partitioned Matrix: a matrix that is divided into smaller matrices by horizontal or vertical lines         drawn between entire rows and columns
Rank: the rank of a matrix is the number of nonzero rows in the matrix after it has been             transformed to row-echelon form by using the elementary row operations
Real-Valued Matrix: a matrix that contains entries which are all real numbers</p>

<p>Row-Echelon Form: a form of a matrix in whichâ€¨    -the first element of each row is 1
-the elements below the first element in each row are zero</p>

<p>Row Vector: a matrix having a single row</p>

<p>Transpose: the transpose of a matrix is the switching of all elements about the diagonal</p>

<p>Vector: a matrix having either one row or one column
Vector Space: a set of vectors where, when you take a linear combination of any two vectors, you     remain inside the set 
Zero Matrix: a matrix containing all zero entries
Zero Vector: a vector containing all zero components</p>
