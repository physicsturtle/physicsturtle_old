<p>In this section, we will discuss limits at infinity. If a limit at infinity exists, it is said to be a horizontal asymptote. The idea of an asymptote can be applied to approximate a function $f(x)$ for large values of $x$, which is useful for approximately solving problems which would otherwise be very difficult/impossible. The idea of a horizontal asymptote is also useful for showing the long time behaviour of physical systems for instance; one might ask how a mass-spring-damper system behaves at a long time after a force is applied to it.</p>

<b>Definition:</b> Suppose that
$$\lim_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x) = L$$
where $L$ is not infinite. Then, we say that $f$ has a horizontal asymptote at $\pm\infty$.

<p>Now letâ€™s proceed with some examples.</p>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x+4}$$
</div>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = \frac{x-2}{2x+3}$$
</div>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = \frac{x^2+3}{x}$$
</div>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x}$$
</div>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = 3e^{2x}$$
</div>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = \frac{3x^2+1}{x^2-2x+1}$$
</div>
