I"Ã<p>Hamiltonian is distinguished from Lagrangian mechanics in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Lagrangian mechanics, the <em>Lagrangian</em> is a function of generalized positions $\textbf{q}$ and velocities $\dot{\textbf{q}}$, while in Hamiltonian mechanics, the <em>Hamiltonian</em> is a function of generalized positions $\textbf{q}$ and generalized momenta $\textbf{p}$.</li>
  <li>In Lagrangian mechanics, the Euler-Lagrange equations for a system with $N$ degrees of freedom is a system of $N$ second order ordinary differential equations. In Hamiltonian mechanics, Hamiltonâ€™s equations for a system with $N$ degrees of freedom are a system of $2N$ first order ordinary differential equations.</li>
