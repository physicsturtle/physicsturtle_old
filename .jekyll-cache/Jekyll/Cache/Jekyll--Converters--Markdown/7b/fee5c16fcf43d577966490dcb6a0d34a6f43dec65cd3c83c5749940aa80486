I"¥	<p>It is possible to solve ODEs with the Fourier transform by finding integral representation for their solution. Many of these integrals cannot be evaluated as elementary functions, but integral representations are useful for other things. For example, one can derive asymptotic formulas for certain special functions, which may be difficult with only a Taylor series representation. We will start by recalling the following useful formula:</p>

\[\mathcal{F}(x^n y^{(m)})(k) = \frac{1}{(-i)^n}\frac{d^n}{dk^n}\left((-ik)^m\mathcal{F}(y)\right)\]

<p>This formula allows us to calculate the Fourier transforms of many types of differential equations. It does of course require that we look for solutions which decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Fourier transform the Bessel differential equation $x^2y'' + xy' + (x^2-n^2)y = 0$.  </p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> We take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. This means that we need to take the Fourier transform of each term. The easiest term is 
$$\mathcal{F}(-n^2y) = -n^2\hat{y}.$$
Next, we do 
$$\mathcal{F}(x^2y) = \frac{1}{(-i)^2}\frac{d^2}{3k^2}\hat{y} = -\hat{y}''$$
The last two are slightly more complicated.
$$\mathcal{F}(xy') = \frac{1}{(-i)}\frac{d}{dk}\left((-ik)\hat{y}\right) = \hat{y} + k\hat{y}',$$
$$\mathcal{F}(x^2y'') = \frac{1}{(-i)^2}\frac{d^2}{dk^2}\left((-ik)^2\hat{y}\right) = 2\hat{y} + 4k\hat{y}' + k^2\hat{y}''.$$
If we add these all together, we get 

$$(k^2 - 1)\hat{y}'' + 5k\hat{y}' + (2-n^2)\hat{y} = 0.$$
Unfortunately, this equation is just as difficult as before! Next, we will do an example that actually simplifies the differential equation and allows us to find an integral representation for a solution.

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Solve the Airy differential equation $y''  = xy$ by using the Fourier transform. </p>
This example will illustrate the method nicely. Taking the Fourier transform of both sides yields
$$-k^2\hat{y} = \frac{1}{-i}\hat{y}'.$$
What we have done is transformed a second order ODE into a first order ODE! We can thus solve this first order ODE for $\hat{y}$, the Fourier transform of $y$. We rewrite the ODE as 
$$\frac{\hat{y}'}{\hat{y}} = ik^2,$$
which gives the following function for $\hat{y}$:
$$\hat{y} = e^{ik^3/3}.$$
Thus a solution to the original differential equation is 
$$y(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{ik^3/3 + ikx} dk$$
