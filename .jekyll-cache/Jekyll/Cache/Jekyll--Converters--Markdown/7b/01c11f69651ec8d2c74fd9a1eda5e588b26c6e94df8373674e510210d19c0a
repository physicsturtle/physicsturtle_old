I"<p>Definition: Let $(S,&lt;)$ be an ordered set, let $E\subset S$, and let $E$ be bounded above. If there exists an element $\alpha\in S$ with the following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\alpha$ is an upper bound for $E$</li>
  <li>If $\gamma\in S$ and $\gamma &lt; \alpha$, then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound for $E$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then we call $\alpha$ the <em>least upper bound</em> of $E$, or, the <em>supremum</em> of $E$. We write $\alpha = \sup E$.</p>

<p>Definition: Let $(S,&lt;)$ be an ordered set, let $E\subset S$, and let $E$ be bounded below. If there exists an element $\alpha\in S$ with the following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\alpha$ is a lower bound for $E$</li>
  <li>If $\gamma\in S$ and $\alpha &lt; \gamma$, then $\gamma$ is not a lower bound for $E$.</li>

<p>Then we call $\alpha$ the <em>greatest lower bound</em> of $E$, or, the <em>infimum</em> of $E$. We write $\alpha = \inf E$.</p>

<p>Definition: An ordered ste $S$ has the least upper bound property if for every $E\subset S$, $E\not= \emptyset$, if $E$ is bounded above, then it has a least upper bound. The least upper bound property is also known as the least upper bound axiom.</p>

<p>Example: Does $\mathbb{Z}$ has the least upper bound property?
Example: Does $\mathbb{Q}$ have the least upper bound property?</p>
