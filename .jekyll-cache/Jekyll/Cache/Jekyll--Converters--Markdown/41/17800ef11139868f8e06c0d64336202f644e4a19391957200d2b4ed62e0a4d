I"!<p>Suppose we are interested in approximating a function $f(x)$ about a certain point $x = a$. Well, a very crude approximation might be $f(x) \approx f(a)$. This is a constant, and it only really works when $x = a$. This isnâ€™t a very good approximation if it only works for a single value of $x$.</p>

<p>As we saw earlier in the course, we could try making a linear approximation to $f$ at $a$. This would look like</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</script>

<p>Now, our approximation matches the function at $a$, and its derivative also matches the function at $a$. We can still do better. Adding a quadratic term improves the approximation even more!</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)(x-a)^2}{2}</script>

<p>This sequence of increasingly accurate approximations can be visaulized in the following graph:</p>

<p>(insert picture here)</p>

<p>This sequence of increasingly accurate approximations is known as a sequence of Taylor polynomials, which we have covered a little bit before. Here, we develop Taylor series, which allow us to approximate a function over a wide range. It will in fact allow us to establish an equality instead of an approximation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x-a)^n.</script>

<p>Now we can calculate the coefficients $c_n$. Consider differentiating the equation $k$ times:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n=k-1}^\infty c_n \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} (x-a)^{n-k}</script>
