<p>Consider a curve $f(x)$. Suppose we already know the value of $f(a)$, but we want to know the value of $f(x)$, with $x$ being quite close to $a$. If we draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x = a$, then this line will be pretty close to $f$ as long as $x$ is close to $a$. We know for sure that it is really easy to plug in values into a linear approximation to get a clean answer, even if it is not possible for the original function!</p>
