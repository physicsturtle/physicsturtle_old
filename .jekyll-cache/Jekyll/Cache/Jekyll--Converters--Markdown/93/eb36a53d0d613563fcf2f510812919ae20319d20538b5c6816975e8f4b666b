I"(<p>The fundamental relation</p>

\[dE = TdS - PdV\]

<p>tells us that</p>

\[T = \frac{\partial E}{\partial S}\bigg|_V,\qquad -P = \frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\bigg|_S.\]

<p>other content here</p>

<p>Sometimes however, we are interested in calculating quantities such as</p>

\[\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\bigg_V.\]

<p>Can we come up with a Maxwell relation that helps with this? Consider the Legendre trasnformed quantity $F = E - TS$. Thus,</p>

\[dF = -SdT - PdV,\]

<p>which tells us that</p>

\[-S = \frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\bigg|_V\]
