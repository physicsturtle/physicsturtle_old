I"¶<p>Degenerate perturbation theory concerns itself with the problem of finding the corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr√∂dinger equation in the case where some of the eigenvalues are degenerate. We will only treat the case of two-fold degeneracy in this course. If you want to learn about worse cases, please see a more advanced course on quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Consider the Schr√∂dinger equation for an unperturbed Hamiltonian</p>

<p>Consider two states $\left|\psi^0_n\right&gt;$</p>
