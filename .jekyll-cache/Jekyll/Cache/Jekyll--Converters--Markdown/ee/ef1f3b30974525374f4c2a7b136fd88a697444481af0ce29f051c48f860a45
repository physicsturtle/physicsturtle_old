I"r<p>If a particle is travelling on a straight line from one point to another, we can describe its position at any point in time by a function $\r(t)$. This function $\r(t)$ is called the <em>position as a function of time</em>. We write it as a vector because it can have multiple components, depending on how many dimensions the particle is moving in. In this course we will discuss motion in 1 or 2 dimensions. If the particle is thrown straight up (ignoring air resistance), then $\r$ would have only one component, the vertical component. If the particle is rolling about on a table, then it would have two components.</p>
