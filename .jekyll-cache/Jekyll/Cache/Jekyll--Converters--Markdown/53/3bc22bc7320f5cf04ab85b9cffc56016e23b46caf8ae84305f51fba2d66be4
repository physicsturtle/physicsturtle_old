<p>An isothermal process is a process whereby the temperature stays constant throughout. Isothermal processes are a little bit more complicated to analyse than the ones we have analysed so far.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>The formula for work says</p>

\[dW = PdV\]

<p>and we need to integrate both sides to find the work. However, $P$ is not constant, but is expressible in terms of $V$ through the ideal gas law. Thus</p>

\[dW = \frac{nRT}{V}dV\]

<p>Now integrating both sides gives us</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
W &amp;=&amp; \int_{V_i}^{V_f} \frac{nRT}{V}dV \\
W &amp;=&amp; nRT\ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right) 
\end{eqnarray}\]
