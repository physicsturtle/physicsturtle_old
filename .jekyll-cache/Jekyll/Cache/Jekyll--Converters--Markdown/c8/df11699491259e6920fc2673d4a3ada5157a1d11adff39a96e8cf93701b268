I"@<p>In single variable calculus, we used Taylor series to approximate differentiable functions. An identical thing can be done for functions of multiple variables, but it is a little bit more complicated. Recall that for an infinitely differentiable function in one variable, its Taylor series about a point \(a\) is</p>
