I"e<p>\begin{definition} A field $F$ is a set on which two operations + and $\cdot$ aredefined so that for each pair of elements $x,y$ in $F$ there are unique elements $x+y$ and $x\cdot y$ in $F$ for which the following conditions hold for all elements $a,b,c$ in $F$.</p>

<p>\begin{itemize}
\item Commutativity of $+$ and $\cdot$: $a+b = b+a$ and $a\cdot b = b\cdot a$
\item Associativity of + and $\cdot$: $(a+b)+c = a + (b+c)$, and $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot(b\cdot c)$
\item Unitality of + and $\cdot$: There exist distinct elements $0,1\in F$ such that $0 + a = a$ and $1\cdot a = a$
\item Existence of inverses of addition and multiplication For each $a\in F$ there is a $b\in F$ with $a+b = 0$. For each nonzero $c\in F$ there is a $d\in F$ for which $c\cdot d = 1$
\item Distributitivity of + and $\cdot$: $(a+b)\cdot c = a\cdot c + b\cdot c$ 
\end{itemize}</p>
