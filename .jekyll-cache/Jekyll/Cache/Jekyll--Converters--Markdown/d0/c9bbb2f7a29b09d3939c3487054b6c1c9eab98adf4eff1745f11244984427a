I"ê<p>In this section, we begin laying out the theory of spin. Recall that, in the theory of angular momentum, we found the commutation relations</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation} [L_x,L_y] = i\hbar L_z,\qquad [L_y,L_z] = i\hbar L_x,\qquad [L_z,L_x] = i\hbar L_x. \end{equation} \label{ccr}</script>

<p>where the angular momentum operators were complicated differential operators. This means that the angular momentum operators were operators on complicated wavefunctions $\psi : \mathbb{R}^3\to \C$. Suppose that I never told you that the $L$â€™s were differential operators. You may as well have guessed that the $L$â€™s were matrices, which we consider as operators on $\R^n$. This is the beauty of the theory of angular momentum; the commutation relations can be applied to other systems! In the theory of angular momentum, we said that the commutation relations $\eqref{ccr}$ described the <em>algebraic theory of angular momentum</em>. In fact, the theory of spin has an identical algebraic theory! The commutation relations in the theory of spin are</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[S_x,S_y] = i\hbar S_z,\qquad [S_y,S_z] = i\hbar S_x,\qquad [S_z,S_x] = i\hbar S_x,</script>

<p>but this time, the operators are matrices instead of differential operators. The wave functions that they act on are now vectors in $\R^n$ instead of functions $\psi : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \C$. We call these wave functions the suggestive name of spinors.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> Determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian 
$$H = -\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot\textbf{B},$$
where $\boldsymbol{\mu} = \mu_B \textbf{S}$ is the magnetic moment. 


&lt;/div&gt;

We now consider a composite system of two spins.
