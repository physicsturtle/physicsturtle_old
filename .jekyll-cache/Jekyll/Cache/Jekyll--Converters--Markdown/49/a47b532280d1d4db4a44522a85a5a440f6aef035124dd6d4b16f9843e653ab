I"M<p>In single variable calculus, we learned that the significance of the derivative was that it was the slope of the function at a point. Here, we will show that the concept of a derivative has the same geometric interpretation as before. However, this time we will be looking at <em>tangent planes</em> instead of tangent lines.</p>
