I"k<p>In the previous section, we introduced the Fourier tranform and how to interpret it. In this section, we introduce some properties of the Fourier transform that allow us to simplify calculations significantly. This will allow us to easily compute Fourier transforms of more complicated functions, as well as pave the way to solving differential equations.</p>
