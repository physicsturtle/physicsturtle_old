<p>Newtonâ€™s law of cooling captures one of the three modes of heat transfer, convection, and we will apply it here to solve problems of cooling and heating. We consider an object of a certain temperature $T$ placed in a room of ambient temperature $T_a$. If $T_a &gt; T$, then we expect that the object will start to heat up, and if $T_a &lt; T$ we expect that the object will start to cool down. The goal is then to find the temperature $T$ of the object as a function of time $t$.</p>
