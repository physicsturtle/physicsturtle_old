I"4<p>Among the most intuitive applications of differential calculus is kinematics problems. In physics, we describe the motion of a particle by specifying its position $x$ as a function of time $t$. This then allows us to calculate the particleâ€™s velocity $v$ and acceleration $a$ by taking derivatives:</p>
