<p>In this section, we will learn how to compute derivatives if there are two functions multiplied together, for example $f(x) = x\sin x$. The product rule is not as simple as the sum rule which we have seen so far, but is intuitive if one thinks about it the right way. We will start simply with what the product rule is, and then have a discussion on the intuition behind it later.</p>
