I"L<p>Consider a system with a spherical metal shell of radius $a$, and a spherical shell outside of it with inner radius $b$ and outer radius $c$. There is a potential difference of $V_0$ between the inner shell and outer shell. The potential is described by Laplaceâ€™s equation</p>

\[\nabla^2 V = 0\]

<p>with boundary conditions $V(a) = $V_0$, and $V(b) = 0$. This is a radially symmetric system, so we rewrite this as</p>

\[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( r^2 \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}\right) = 0\]

<p>Multiplying by $r^2$ and then integrating both sides gives us</p>

\[r^2\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = c_1\]

<p>Now dividing by $r^2$ and integrating again,</p>

\[V = c_2 - \frac{c_1}{r}\]

<p>If we plug in the boundary conditions, we get the final solution, which holds for $a &lt; r &lt; b$.</p>

\[V(r) = \frac{V_0}{1-b/a}\left(1 - \frac{b}{r}\right)\]

<p>Now, we can construct the full solution</p>

\[V(r) = \begin{cases}
V_0 &amp; 0 &lt; r &lt; a \\
\frac{V_0}{1-b/a}\left(1 - \frac{b}{r}\right) &amp; a &lt; r &lt; b\\
0 &amp; b &lt; r &lt; \infty
\end{cases}\]
