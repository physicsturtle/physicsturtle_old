<p>So far, we have learned how to differentiate functions like $f(x) = x^n$ as well as functions like $f(x) = e^x$. The case of polynomial functions has the variable in the base and a constant in the exponent. The case of the exponential function has the constant in the base and the variable in the exponent. What happens if we allow both the base and exponent to vary? The method of logarithmic differentiation is best illustrated with an example.</p>
