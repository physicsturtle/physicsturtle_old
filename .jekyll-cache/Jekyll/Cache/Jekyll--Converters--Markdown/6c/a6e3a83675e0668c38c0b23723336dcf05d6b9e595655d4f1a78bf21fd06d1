I"<p>The free electron model assumes that none of the electrons interact with one another, nor with the underlying lattice structure. One may think that this is a gross oversimplification of a solid, but the model actually makes some reasonable predictions in certain systems, namely metals. Of all the metals, alkali metals and alkali earth metals are the metals which are better described by the free electron model.</p>

<p>The Schr√∂dinger equation for the free electron model is written by setting $V(x) \equiv 0$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi(\x) = E\psi(\x).</script>

<p>There are various boundary conditions that one can pick for the equation. Suppose that the system is confined to a cube with side length $L$. Then, the</p>
