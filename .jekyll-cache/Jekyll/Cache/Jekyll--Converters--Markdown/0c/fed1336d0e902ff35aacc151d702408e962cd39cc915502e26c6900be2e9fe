I")<p>So far we have looked at functions of the form $y = f(x)$, where $y$ is explicitly determined in terms given any $x$. It is also possible to construct curves in the $xy$ plane for which it is not possible to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$. For example, the points which satisfy the equation</p>
