<p>Here we will discuss how to calculate the arc length of a curve. Suppose we have a curve $\textbf{r}(t)$ defined on an interval $t\in (a,b)$. Then the length of the curve over the interval is</p>

\[L = \int_a^b |\textbf{r}'(t)| dt\]

<p>The main purpose of learning to compute arc length is its use in reparametrization. One can reparametrize a curve in terms of its arc length, and this leads to a few nice properties.</p>
