I"Ô<p>In classical statistical physics, we study laws that govern macroscopic bodies. These macroscopic bodies are made up of many microscopic bodies, and it is the fact that there are ‚Äúmany‚Äù microscopic bodies which allows us to make the formulations accurate. The approximations that we will make become precise only because there are so many bodies.</p>

<p>Consider a mechanical system with phase space coordinates $(\textbf{q},\textbf{p})$, and suppose that the system has $s$ degrees of freedom. Recall that having $s$ degrees of freedom means that the vector $\textbf{q}$ has $s$ components.</p>

<p>If we wanted to know the behaviour of such a system, we could write down Hamilton‚Äôs equations and then solve them. However, even if $s$ is small, this is quite a difficult task, at least analytically! It also becomes unwieldly numerically for the cases we are interested in; $s$ is on the order of Avogadro‚Äôs number!</p>

<p>Our approach instead is to consider subsystems of the total system. Note that we only consider subsystems which are still macroscopic and still have many bodies in them.</p>

<p>The fundamental assumption that we make is that, after a sufficiently long time, the any subsystem will be in every possible state many times.</p>
