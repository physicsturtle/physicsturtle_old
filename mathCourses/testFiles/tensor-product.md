In our discussion of the tensor product, we will start with abstraction, then eventually reduce to a basis, which will allow us to make the ideas more concrete. We will only discuss the tensor product in the context of vector spaces; a similar object is defined in abstract algebra and is called the direct product. Being completely rigorous in our definitions is rather difficult at this stage; we want to keep this exposition open to mathematicians and physicists. This will be made more rigorous in further linear algebra material.
