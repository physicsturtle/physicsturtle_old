### Introduction

The summation of series has been studied for many years, with several famous results having been derived in many different ways. For example, you may have seen 

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6},$$

which was first derived by Euler (check this!). We will study how to sum results of that form (check this!) and others through the use of complex analysis.
