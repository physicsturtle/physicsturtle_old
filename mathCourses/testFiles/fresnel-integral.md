In this section, we will evaluate the Fresnel integral rigorously using complex analysis. To do this integral, we consider integrating the complex function $f(z) = e^{iz^2}$ along the contour of three parts. 
1. From the origin to the point $R$. 
2. From the point $R$ to $Re^{i\theta}$, for some value of $\theta$. (what needs to be true about the value of $\theta$?)
3. Back to the origin.
