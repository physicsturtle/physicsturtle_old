Consider solving the equation 

$$au_x + bu_y = 0$$

where $u = u(x,y)$ is a differentiable function, and $a$ and $b$ are real constants. This is equivalent to 

$$(a,b)\cdot(u_x,u_y) = (a,b)\cdot\nabla u = 0$$

If we divide by the constant $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, this can be expressed in terms of a directional derivative. 

$$\frac{(a,b)}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\cdot\nabla u = 0 $$

This gives us the following geometric interpretation:
