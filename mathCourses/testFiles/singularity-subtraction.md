Here we will investigate one of the methods of evaluating integrals asymptotically. 

Suppose we had the integral

$$I = \int_0^1 \frac{\sin(x)}{\epsilon^2 + x^2} dx$$

As $\epsilon\to 0$, the integral becomes logarithmically divergent. One way to simplify the problem is 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\int_0^1 \frac{\sin(x)}{\epsilon^2 + x^2} dx 
\end{eqnarray}$$
