In real analysis, we study the real numbers. But why do we need the real numbers? Is it not possible to do calculus without them? You probably already have some sort of intuitive idea that there are gaps in the rational numbers which are filled by the real numbers. In this section we will look at why there are problems with the rational numbers and why we need the reals.

The natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = \\{1,2,3,4,\dots\\}$

The integers $\mathbb{Z} = \\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\\}$. We use $\mathbb{Z}$ to denote this set because the German word *Zahl* means number. 

The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} = \left\\{\frac{m}{n} : m\in\mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{N}\right\\}$.

We say that two rational numbers $x = \frac{m_1}{n_1}$ and $y = \frac{m_2}{n_2}$ are *identified* if $m_1n_2 = m_2n_1$. This creates an equivalence relation. 

Let's now show one of the problems with the rational numbers. Consider solving the equation $p^2 = 2$. This equation does not have a solution for rational $p$. Let us prove this now:

### Exercises
<ol> 
<li><div> The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ can be thought of as ordered pairs, $(m,n)$: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{(m,n): m\in\mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$. Define the relation $R$ such that $(m_1,n_1) R (m_2,n_2)$ if $m_1n_2 = m_2n_1$. Show that $R$ is an equivalence relation. </div>
