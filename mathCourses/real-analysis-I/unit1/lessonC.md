Definition: Let $(S,<)$ be an ordered set and $E\subset S$. We say that $E$ is *bounded above* if $\exists\beta\in S$ such that $\forall x\in E$, $x \leq \beta$. If such a $\beta$ exists, then we say that $\beta$ is an *upper bound* for $E$.

### Exercises
<ol> 
<li><div> The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ can be thought of as ordered pairs, $(m,n)$: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{(m,n): m\in\mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$. Define the relation $R$ such that $(m_1,n_1) R (m_2,n_2)$ if $m_1n_2 = m_2n_1$. Show that $R$ is an equivalence relation. </div>
