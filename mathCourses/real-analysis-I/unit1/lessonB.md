Definition: Let $S$ be a set. Then an *order* on $S$ is a relation $<$ on $S$ which satisfies the following properties:
1. For every $x,y\in S$, one and only one of the following is true:
$$x < y, \quad x = y,\quad y < x$$
2. For $x,y,z\in S$, if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$. 

Examples of orders on $S = \mathbb{N},\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$. 

could have $S$ be the words in the English language, where $<$ is the dictionary order. This is known as the lexicographical order. 

Let $S$ be a nonempty set. Is $\mathcal{P}(S)$ with the order $A < B$ if $A\subset B$ an order? 



### Exercises
<ol> 
<li><div> The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ can be thought of as ordered pairs, $(m,n)$: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{(m,n): m\in\mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$. Define the relation $R$ such that $(m_1,n_1) R (m_2,n_2)$ if $m_1n_2 = m_2n_1$. Show that $R$ is an equivalence relation. </div>

<li> <div>  Every rational number has a lowest form. In this lowest form, $m$ and $n$ share no common factors, and $n$ is as small as possible. Show that every rational number has a lowest form, and furthermore, that it is unique. </div>
