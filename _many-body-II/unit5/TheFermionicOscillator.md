We start with the simplest possible example. We have a system with two levels: unoccipied and occupied. The Hamiltonian is

$$$$\begin{align}
\Hhat = \epsilon \hat{\psi}^\dagger\hat{\psi}
\end{align}$$$$

and it is position independent. Including the chemical potential, the corresponding field theory is 

$$$$\begin{align}
S = \int_0^\beta \left[\bar{\psi}\partial_\tau\psi + \epsilon\bar{\psi}\psi \right] \d\tau
\end{align}$$$$

Let's show that the Euler-Lagrange equation of this action is the time evolution (is this true?). Next, let's find the Green function of the system

$$$$\begin{align}G = i\left<\psi^\dagger\psi\right>\end{align}$$$$

and show that it is also the Green function of the Euler-Lagrange equation.
