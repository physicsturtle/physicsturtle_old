There are two forms of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which we will apply in this course. One is for a real Hubbard-Stratonovich field, and the second is for a complex one. For the real version, the identity is easily verified as:

$$\int e^{-ax^2-bx}\d x = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}e^{b^2/4a}.$$

For a complex field, we instead have that 

$$\int e^{-a|z|^2 - bz^{*} - b^{*}z} \d\Re(z)\d\Im(z) = $$

We will also shortly generalize these to the vector form, and then the path integral form, which we will find useful in our actual calculations.
