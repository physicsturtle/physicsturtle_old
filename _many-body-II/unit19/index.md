Bosonization is a technique useful in 1 spatial dimension for turning a theory of interacting fermions into a theory of noninteracting bosons. This duality also exists in higher dimensions but is only exact in 1 dimension. We can use the technique to study various models such as the Fermi-Hubbard model, the Luttinger model, the Heisenberg model, or the Kondo model. Despite being an impurity in 3D, the Kondo model is in fact mappable to a 1 D model, which is where bosonization's utility emerges. 

To start our treatment, we will show how the duality works for a theory of noninteracting fermions, and show how we can obtain a theory of noninteracting bosons. After doing this pedagogical step, we can move onto interacting examples. 

We will compute correlation functions in the free fermion theory, and also compute correlations in the free boson theory. These will be shown to be the same in every case.
