\begin{remark}
BEC vs. SF:

in the sense that they don?t necesarily go hand in hand. in one of the new hw problems, is to work out the analogue in 1 lower dimension. in 2D, at finite temperature, then the correlations of the superfluid order parameter, if you try to calculate the boson correlations, they decay as a power law with distance. that tells you that there is no long range order in that system in 2D. that precludes bose condensation. this does not imply that the SF is gone. you can calculate the SF response and it is finite. therefore they are disconnected from each other in 2D

if you look at this in a 1+1 D probelm at 0T, then the analogue of this turns out to be a luttinger liquid. you will only have power law correlations of the boson, and in the PS you have a simplistic version of luttinger liquid. that?s the problem to compute some of those correlations in the quantum problem in 1D.
