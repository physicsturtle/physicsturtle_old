In this section, we will study the \\(t\\)-\\(J\\) model. The model describes electrons hopping on a lattice in the presence of a large on-site repulsion. This large on-site repulsion restricts the Hilbert space to contain only singly occupied and empty sites, at least for less than half-filling. This is the the model that many believe to be the basis for high-\\(T_c\\) superconductivity in the cuprates. However, since this is a many-body physics course, not a superconductivity or magnetism course, we will be sloppy and pretend as though there are no constraints on the Hilbert space. In this simplified and approximate situation, we can study superconductivity in this model. 

The model is (without projectors)

$$H = -t\sum_{\left<i,j\right>,\sigma} \chat^\dagger_{i\sigma} \chat_{j\sigma} + J\sum_{\left<i,j\right>}\left(\hat{\textbf{S}}_i\cdot\hat{\textbf{S}}_j - \frac{\nhat_i\nhat_j}{4}\right)$$
