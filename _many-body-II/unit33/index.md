In this section, we will discuss what a gauge theory is.

\begin{definition_wrapper}
\begin{definition}
A gauge theory is a theory in which we use more than one label to label the same quantum state. Gauge 'symmetry' is not actually a symmetry and cannot be broken.
\end{definition}
\end{definition_wrapper}


<div class="example">
<b>Example:</b>

Let's now discuss breaking the symmetry for the case of the particle on a line in a periodic potential.

<ul>
<li> If we take the point of view of a particle on a line with a periodic potential, then if we add a perturbation to the system, we break the discrete translation symmetry.
</li> 
 <li> However, if we look at the circle case, then we already have that \\(\ket{x} \equiv \ket{x+a}\\), so no matter what perturbing potential we add, we still have the gauge structure.
\end{itemize}

<div class="example">
<b>Example:</b>
In ordinary single particle quantum mechanics, we would say that two wave functions \\(\psi(x)\\) and \\(\phi(x)\\) are the same physical state if \\(\psi(x) = e^{i\theta}\phi(x)\\). 

This is actually an example of a gauge symmetry, because it is creating a redundancy in the Hilbert space.


The \\(\theta\\) should be the same for any \\(n\\) (where \\(n\\) represents energy eigenstates for example)

IS THIS EXAMPLE CORRECT?
