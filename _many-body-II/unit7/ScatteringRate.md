THe scattering rate is given by 

$$\frac{1}{\tau} = -2Z\Im\Sigma^R(\k,\omega)$$

This is because, if we write the Green function as 

$$G(\k,\omega) = \frac{Z}{\omega - \xi_{\tilde{\k}} + i/2\tau}$$

If we had that \\(\tau\\) were a constant, we could Fourier transform this Green function back to real time and show that 

$$G(\k,t) = ???e^{-t/2\tau}$$

The square of the Green function gives....
