We will take a small diversion to spin models. Although this course is primarily concerned with interacting fermions and bosons, we will consider spin models only to the extent that they will be useful for coupling to conduction electrons in the Kondo lattice model. For a more thorough treatment of spin models, we also have a quantum magnetism course.
