We recall the self-energy and its definition

$$\Sigma = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \left<S_\text{int}^n \bar{\psi}_{k\sigma} \psi_{k\sigma} \right>_{0,\text{conn,1PI}}$$

In most cases, the \\(1/n!\\) factor will cancel out because there are \\(n!\\) diagrams which yield the same contribution. Sometimes, the matrix structure of a diagram may differ, and then certain diagrams will need to be treated separately. Such cases will not be considered in these notes. Thus we write 

$$\Sigma = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \left<S_\text{int}^n \bar{\psi}_{k\sigma} \psi_{k\sigma} \right>_{0,\text{conn,1PI,top}}$$


The subset of diagrams in the single-particle Green function which correspond to the 1 particle irreducible ones found in the self energy
