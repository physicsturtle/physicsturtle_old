In this section, we will develop the Feynman path integral for fermions. This will differ from how it was developed for bosons in that, for the bosonic case we replaced \\(a\\) and \\(a^\dagger\\) with the fields \\(\phi\\) and \\(\phi^{*}\\), where \\(\phi : \RR^d\to \chat\\). In this approach, for two commuting operators, this was preserved when we moved to the field theory because two complex numbers also commute. In the fermionic case, we replace the operators \\(c\\) and \\(\chat^\dagger\\) with fields \\(\Psi\\) and \\(\Psi^\dagger\\). However, any anticommutation that we had in the second quantized Hamiltonian must be preserved when we move to the field theory. This calls for the introduction of a new kind of number, called the Grassmann number. Grassmann numbers are related to complex numbers, but they anticommute instead of commute. The field \\(\Psi\\) is a Grassmann number-valued function on \\(\RR^d\\).
