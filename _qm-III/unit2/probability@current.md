In this section, we will start by introducing the probability current in 1 dimension, then proceed to a discussion of the probability current in 3 dimensions. 

### Probability Current in 1 Dimension
The probability current is defined as 
$$J = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\psi^*\frac{d\psi}{dx} - \psi\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\right)$$

We can prove a conservation relation for the probability current 


### Probability Current in 3 Dimensions
The probability current can be generalized to 3 dimensions
$$\textbf{J} = \frac{\hbar}{2m i}\left(\psi^*\nabla\psi - \psi\nabla\psi^*\right)$$

and can again be written in terms of the momentum operator, 

$$\textbf{J} = \frac{1}{2m}\left(\psi^*\hat{\textbf{p}}\psi - \psi\hat{\textbf{p}}\psi^*\right).$$
