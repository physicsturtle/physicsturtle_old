1. Normalize $$A\left(e^{ikx} + e^{-ikx}\right)$$ in the $k$ scale. 

2. (find the tunneling wave function first) Normalize the wave function which has a continuum part and a tunneling part.

3. Normalize $$A\left(e^{ikx} + \alpha e^{-ikx}\right)$$ in the $k$ scale. (make a remark about what region of $x$ this should be done over, and what normalization this gives for a transmitted wave etc.)
