- What is a contour plot
- contour plots in the plane, contour surfaces
- How to draw contour plots
- Match contour plots with functions

Due to the fact that drawing 3D plots is hard and sometimes hard to interpret, here we will discuss another method of visualizing functions in multiple dimensions: contour plots.
