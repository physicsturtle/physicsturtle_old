<li> <div class="exercise">  <ol type="a">
<li> Calculate the classical action for a particle of mass \(m\) moving in a harmonic potential well \(V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2\), where the particle starts at \(x_a\) and ends at \(x_b\).
</li>
<li> Expand a general trajectory between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) as 
\(\)x(t) = x_\text{cl}(t) + x_q(t)\(\)

where \(x_\text{cl}\) is classical solution found in part (a), and \(x_q(t_a) = x_q(t_b) = 0\).
