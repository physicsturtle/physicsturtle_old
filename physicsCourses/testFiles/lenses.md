There are two types of lenses: convex lenses, which are thicker in the centre than at the edges, and concave lenses, which are thinner in the centre than at the edges.

The principal axis of a lens is a straight line that passes through the centre of the lens and perpendicular to its surfaces

Focal point and focal length: 

Every lens has two focal points, one for light raysp assing through in one direction, and one for light rays passing through in the other direction.

The focal length of a lens is the distance of hte focal point from the centre of hte lens. THe focal length of a lens depends on its shape and on the indices of refraction of the lens material and the surrounding medium. 

For a convex lens, incident rays parallel to the principal axis converge to the focal point of the lens after passing through the lens. A convex lens ia converging lens. 

For a concave lens, incident rays parallel to hte principal axis diverge after passing through the lens., and seem to originate form the focal point of the lens. A concave lens is a diverging lens.
