Consider the Schrödinger equation for a single particle in 3 dimensions, 

$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\x)\right]\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}.$$

The corresponding problem for the Green's function is 

$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\x) - i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right]\G(\x',t';\x,t) = -i\hbar\delta^3(\x'-\x)\delta(t-t').$$

To solve this problem, we first take the Laplace transform in time of both sides of the equation. This gives us
