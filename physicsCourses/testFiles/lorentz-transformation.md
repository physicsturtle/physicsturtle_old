The postulates of special relativity are:
1. Physics is the same in all inertial reference frames
2. The speed of light is the same in all reference frames (be they inertial or not)

This allows us to derive some properties of transforming between reference frames.

Imagine each point in an inertial reference frame has a clock attached to it. These clocks are all synchronized with one another. Additionally, we have metre sticks with which we can measure distances. Each of these metre sticks is the same length.

Consider a light clock. This is constructed with two mirrors which have light bouncing between them. We measure one tick of the clock as when the light hits the bottom mirror. Suppose this light clock is observed from two different reference frames. One frame is stationary with respect to the light clock. The second frame is moving at a speed $v$ with respect to the clock.
