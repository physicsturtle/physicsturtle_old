In this section, we will define different kinds of quantum systems. 

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> An <i> open quantum system </i> is one which interacts with an external quantum system. This could be an environment or a bath. 
</div>

These interactions can substantially change the dynamics of the system, and they lead to quantum dissipation. Quantum dissipation is the loss of information to the environment.
