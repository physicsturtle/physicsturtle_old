In this section, we will rigorously develop the Debye model, which is useful in statistical or condensed matter physics for calculating heat capacities of solids. 

Consider $N$ atoms in a line. Atoms can move longitudinally or transversally. Let's construct the Hamiltonian for this system. 

$$H = \sum_j \frac{\textbf{p}_j^2}{2m} + \frac{k}{2}\left(\textbf{q}_{j+1} - \textbf{q}_j\right)^2.$$

What are the normal modes of the system?
