The basic idea behind single variable calculus is having two variables. One dependent, and one independent. For example, the dependent variable distance along an axis an object is a function of the independent variable time. Multi-variable calculus aims to allow one to perform similar calculations, but allowing many more degrees of freedom. The three new types of problems are exemplified by the following.

1. The description of the movement of a particle moving in 3D space, rather than just along a line. 
2. The study of a gravitational or electric potential as it varies throughout 3D space.
3. The study of velocity fields of a fluid throughout 3D space.

If any of those terms or examples are unfamiliar to you, don't worry as we will be going into much more depth later on.

In addition to many physical problems, multi-variable calculus also involves problems in optimization, geometry, probability, economics, and other areas of science and economics and more. Within this course we will not be able to explore all of these areas, but hope to at least touch on physics, optimization, geometry, and probability.

We aim for the student to become proficient in computation, and to have a physical intuition behind the material as well.
