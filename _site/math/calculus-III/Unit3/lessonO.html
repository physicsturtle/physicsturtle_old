  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The method of <em>Lagrange Multipliers</em>  is  mathematical tool for optimizing functions with respect to a constraint on the independent variables. This has many physical and mathematical applications. Suppose we are studying air flow past the roof on a house, and that if the air speed at any point on the roof surpasses a certain threshold, the roof will be fail. What we need to do is examine the speed of the air at only the points in space on the surface of the roof, and find the maximum speed at the surface of the roof.</p>

<p>This is an example of a constrained optimization problem. We have a speed of air defined at every point in space, but we want to find the maximum speed only on a surface of interest, which is the roof of the house. This is a subset of all space.</p>

<p>There are also mathematical examples that we can consider. Suppose there is an irregularly shaped surface, and we want to find the point on that surface which is closest to the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). This problem concerns minimizing the function \(f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) (distance from the origin squared), when the point we’re measuring the distance to is constrained to the surface given.</p>

<p>Now that we have discussed some examples, we can lump together these different kinds of problems into a mathematical framework that allows us to formulate a general method of solution. To begin the analysis, let’s restrict ourselves to functions of only two variables. Suppose we have a function \(z = f(x,y)\) which we want to minimize or maximize, subject to the constraint \( g(x,y) = c\). Graphing (f\) gives us a surface, and the constraint is actually a curve in the plane. This curve can be swept upwards, because since \(g\) is independent of \(z\), it holds at any point on the \(z\) axis. We then look at the curve of intersection between the surfaces \(f\) and \(g\). Flattening out this curve, we can see the problem we’re trying to solve: find the minimum and maximum along this curve!</p>

<p>\subsection{Analysis of the Problem}
This problem can be solved by creating contour plots of the function we need to optimize. The constraint \(g\) can be drawn as a curve in the (\xy\) plane. Suppose we want to optimize the function (f), whose level sets are shown. We want to find the level set of the smallest value of \(f\) for which \(f\) still satisfies the constraint. If we look at the level set for (\f = 6\), we see that there exist smaller values of (f) for which the constraint is still satisfied! We can then proceed to \(f = 4\), but then there are still further smaller values of \(f\) for which the constraint is satisfied! Continuing down until we are on the level set (f = 2), we see that if we continued for any smaller value of (f), we would no longer be able to satisfy the constraint. We therefore conclude that the level set of the function \(f\) must be tangent to the curve given by the constraint (g). An equivalent statement to this is that the normal vectors to the two curves are parallel, so \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\) for some real number \(\lambda\). An identical argument can be applied if we wish to maximize the function \(f\) subject to a constraint (g). the scalar (\lambda\) is called the \textit{Lagrange Multiplier}.</p>

<p>To find the minimum/maximum points of a function (f) with respect to a constraint (g), we need to solve the system of equations (\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g), and (g = c), for (x,y,\lambda). This may look like only two equations, but it is actually 3 equations, because the gradient is a vector equation.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
f_x(x,y) &=& \lambda g_x(x,y)\\
f_y(x,y) &=& \lambda g_y(x,y)\\
g(x,y) &=& k
\end{eqnarray} %]]></script>

<p>Example1: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function (f(x,y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2) subject to (xy = 1)</p>

<p>\begin{solution}
We begin by identifying that constraint is (g(x,y) = xy). Then we compute the gradient of both functions:
[\nabla f = \langle 4x , 6y \rangle ]
[\nabla g = \langle y, x \rangle ]
Then setting up the Lagrange multipliers equation, we have 
[\langle 4x, 6y = \lambda \langle y , x \rangle ]
Which gives us the three equations 
\begin{displaymath}
\left{
\begin{array}{c}
4x= \lambda y<br />
6y = \lambda x <br />
xy = 1
\end{array}
\right.
\end{displaymath}
Assuming that (\lambda \not= 0), we can divide the first two equations to obtain
[\frac{2x}{3y} = \frac{y}{x} \Rightarrow 2x^2 = 3y^2]
Then multiplying the equation on both sides by (y^2), we have 
[2x^2y^2 = 3y^4 = 2, ]
because we used the constraint (xy = 1). Thus we get (y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}), and (x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}), thus our two solutions are 
[(x,y) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right),\quad   \left(-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}, -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right)]
We see the graphic to confirm that these solutions do indeed satisfy the condition of extremal points. Examining the level sets also confirms that they are tangent at these particular points. The level set of (f) that is tangent to (g = 1) happens to be the set (f = 5). This is obtained by plugging back our values into the function (f). 
\end{solution}</p>

<p>Example 2: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function (f(x,y) =  ) on the unit disk (x^2 + y^2 \leq 1).</p>

<p>\begin{solution}
To solve this problem, we will have to use optimization techniques learned before to find any extremal values inside the disk, and use Lagrange multipliers to find any extremal values on the edge of the disk. 
\end{solution}</p>
