    <p>Hello and welcome to a first course in electricity and magnetism! Affectionately known as E&amp;M or “emag, this course is designed for first year undergraduate students of physical sciences or engineering. This subject is a personal favourite of mine, and I’m very excited to be sharing it with you all. I think the reason that I like it so much is that it is such a clean theory and has many interesting problems that can be solved analytically, which is always fun for the mathematically inclined student.</p>

<p>This course will likely be the student’s first physics course that employs tools from integral calculus. We do not want to expect too much from the student on the calculus front, so if the problem gives rise to an unwieldy integral, we will provide some mathematical hints to help the student on the way to a solution; we don’t want the mathematics to interfere with the physics. Additionally, this will probably the student’s first course where the majority of the problems take place without numbers, and are primarily having to do with symbolic manipulation, even in the final answer. This is a theme throughout all more advanced courses, and I think it is a change that you’ll all find very convenient.</p>

<p>We will take an approach that will introduce the student to systematic ways to solve basic problems in electromagnetism. The course will also include basic topics regarding waves and optics, as well as the study of electric circuits. It is the first course in a long stream of electromagnetism courses, and building up a strong foundation in problem solving here will be immeasurably helpful in future electromagnetism courses, as well as in optics and quantum mechanics courses. The student will learn to apply their new mathematical toolbox to solving problems that they would have been unable to solve in high school, and gain a deeper insight into the relationship between mathematics and physics.</p>

<p>In learning physics in the modern world of computers, we will include programming exercises that will allow us to calculate results that are not possible to do by hand! No matter what career to expect to pursue, if it uses physics, programming skills will be indispensable. This is something that is missing from some physics courses, and we hope you find the programming exercises just as useful as the theoretical exercises.</p>
