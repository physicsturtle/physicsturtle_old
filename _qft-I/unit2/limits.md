### Introduction

In this section, we will introduce the idea of the limit of a function. This is best done via a picture. Consider the following plot of $y = f(x)$, particularly about the point $x = a$. What happens to the value of $y$ as we approach $x = 1$ from the left? The value of $y$ gets closer and closer to 

(insert figure here)
