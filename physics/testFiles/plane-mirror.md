For a plane mirror, the image is always virtual, upright, and the same size as the object. It is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. We denote the image height by $h_i$ and the object height as $h_o$, the distance from the plane of the mirror to the image as $d_i$, and the distance from the plane of the mirror to the object as $d_o$. The plane mirror has the property that $d_i = d_o$, and $h_i = h_o$. The image has left-right reversal.
