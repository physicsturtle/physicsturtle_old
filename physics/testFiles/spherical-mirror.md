A spherical mirror has the shape of a section from the surface of a sphere. It can be concave or convex. The centre of curvature is the point where the sphere would be. The principal axis is the line connecting the centre of curvature to the midpoint of the mirror. It is always perpendicular to the curved surface. 

The focal point of a spherical mirror is a point on the principal axis. It is exactly halfway between the centre of curvature and the surface of the mirror. 

The focal length is the distance along the principal axis between the focal point and the surface of the mirror. Its value is exactly half that of the radius of curvature. 

If the mirror is concave, incident rays which are parallel to the principal axis converge to the focal point in front of the mirror after reflection, and we take this focal length as positive: $f = R/2$. 

If the mirror is convex, then incident rays parallel to the principal axis diverge after reflection, and appear to originate from the focal point behind the mirror, and we take this focal length as negative: $f = -R/2$. 

Spherical aberration is the effect that rays which are parallel to the principal axis, but are far from the principal axis, do not actually converge/diverge to/from the focal point (for concave mirrors/convex mirrors). Those are approximations which hold only for rays which are close to the principal axis. Since they don't converge to this single point, the image is blurry.
