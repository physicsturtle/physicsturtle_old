The partition function is the sum of all the Boltzmann factors. if $E(s)$ is the energy of microstate $s$, then the Boltzmann factor is 

$$e^{-E(s)/kT}$$

and the partition function is the sum of all of the Boltzmann factors.

$$Z = \sum_s e^{-E(s)/kT}$$

The probability of measuring the system in state $s$ is given by 

$$P(s) = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-E(s)/kT}$$
