Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles of the edges of an opening. 

Huygen's principle says that every point on a wave-front acts as a source of tine wavelets that move forward with the same speed as the wave, and the new wavefrtont is the surface that is tangent to the wavelets. 

The amount by which waves are diffracted around the edges of an opening is determined by the ratio of the wavelength of the wave to the width of the opening. 

$$\theta = \frac{\lambda}{W}$$

The wavelength of light is very short. This means that the diffraction angle $\theta$ is very small, and this is why we can hear around corners, but not see around corners.
