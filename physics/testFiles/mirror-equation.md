Here we will discuss how we can calculate with mirrors. There are two important equations: 

$$\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} =  \frac{1}{f}$$

where $f$ is the focal length. We need to take into account sign here. 


We also have the magnification equation:

$$m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$

these come with the following sign conventions:

1. $f$ is positive for a concave mirror and negative for a convex mirror
2. $m$ is positive for an upright image and negative for an inverted image
3. $d_i$ is positive for an image in front of the mirror (real image) and negative for an object behind a mirror (virtual image)
4. $d_o$ is positive for an object in front of the mirror (real object) and negative for an object behind a mirror (virtual object)
