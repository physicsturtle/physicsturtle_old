The fundamental relation

$$dE = TdS - PdV$$

tells us that 

$$T = \frac{\partial E}{\partial S}\bigg|_V,\qquad -P = \frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\bigg|_S.$$

Sometimes however, we are interested in calculating quantities such as 

$$\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\bigg_V.$$

Can we come up with a Maxwell relation that helps with this? Consider the Legendre trasnformed quantity $F = E - TS$. Thus, 

$$dF = -SdT - PdV,$$

which tells us that 

$$-S = \frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\bigg|_V$$
