Why is the band structure important? What can be concluded by looking at the band structure? For example, insulator, conductor, semiconductor. 

Note that one gets a Fermi surface for each band which crosses the Fermi energy.

Question: Does the band structure change when temperature is changed?
Answer: No! The bands that are occupied might change, but the band structure itself should stay constant.
