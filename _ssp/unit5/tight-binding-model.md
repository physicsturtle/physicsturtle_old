In this section, we will outline another method for calculating band structures. As per its name, it assumes that electrons primarily experience the potential due to atoms in the lattice, and the perturbation is the effect of neighbouring atoms. This can be constrasted with the nearly free electron model, in which the electrons were primarily free, and the perturbation was the effect of a small periodic potential. 

The tight binding model is well suited for wide gap insulators in which the wave function overlap between neighbouring atoms is small, and the distance between neighbouring atoms is large.
