- Geometric interpretation of triple integration
- Riemann sums
- calculating volumes using triple integrals
- calculate an integral using riemmann sums

Triple integrals are, in general, more difficult to visualize geometrically, because we would need four dimensions! There are however many physical applications that make the concept of a triple integral very transparent. Let us consider a function

$$f : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R},$$

and suppose that we are interested in integrating it over a region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$.
