### Introduction

One dimensional systems are first order differential equations in one variable. The study of linear systems is already very well understood, but we allow our systems to be nonlinear in this course. This produces many interesting phenomena that do not occur in linear systems. However, it is often useful to take these nonlinear systems and linearize them to determine their behaviour near certain equilibrium points. 

### Equilibrium Points
Consider a system $\dot{x} = f(x)$, with initial condition $x(0) = x_0$. The goal is to find the function $x(t)$ for $t > 0$. This function is very difficult to find, but there very simple solutions at the roots of $f$. Suppose $x_*$ satisfies $f(x_*) = 0$. 


### Exercises
<ol> 
<li><div> Plot the points $P = (2,-1,2)$, $Q = (-3,-3,1)$, and $R = (0,2,-1)$ on a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. </div>

<div  id="answer1" class="answer">
To plot these points, we should draw lines from each of the axes to show where the points are. Without these lines, it could be ambiguous where points are.
