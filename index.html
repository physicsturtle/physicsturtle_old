<p> Hello everyone! Welcome to Zestymath, the number one place for university level math and physics! Whether you're a particularly motivated high school student, a university student looking for homework help, or a self-learner, I hope that you can find what you're looking for. </p>

<p> The primary purpose of the website is to bring a student from a novice background up to having the background to do work in theoretical physics, with all material being self-contained. Everything is written from the perspective of a physicist. I will include every topic which I feel is necessary to the training of a physics student in their undergraduate years, as well as a few extra mathematics courses which may be of interest to certain students. </p>

<p> Here in these figures, I have some graphics representing an approximate d-orbital wave-function of helium calculated by a Hartree-Fock self-consistent-field approach. </p>
