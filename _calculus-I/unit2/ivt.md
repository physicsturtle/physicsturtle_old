### Introduction

In the last section, we introduced the idea of the tangent line to a curve, and how that can be calculated by using a limit. In this section, we will compute limits of functions and learn rules for simplifying limit calculations. There is a rigorous approach to limits, but we will not explore it in detail here; there will be an alternate limits lesson that you can read if you're interested.



### Idea of a Limit

Suppose we have a function $f(x) = x^2$. As $x$ approaches 2, it is clear that $f(x)$ approaches 4. 



<ol>
<li> <div> Calculate the dot product between the vectors \(\textbf{a} = (3,1)\) and \(\textbf{b} = (-2,1)\). </div>

<button onclick="myFunction('answer1')" class="answerButton">Show Answer</button>
<div  id="answer1" class="answer">
This is a straightforward computation in two dimensions, which gives 
$$\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{b} = (3)(-2)+(1)(1) = -6 + 1 = -5$$ 
</div> </li>

</ol>
