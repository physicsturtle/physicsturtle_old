### Introduction
Suppse you have a metal rod. One side is heated to 100$\degree$C, and one is cooled to 0$\degree$C. Must there exist a point somewhere in the middle which is 50$\degree$C? Temperature is a continuous function, so I claim that there must exist a point somewhere in the middle which is 50$\degree$C. This is precisely the statement of the intermediate value theorem.
