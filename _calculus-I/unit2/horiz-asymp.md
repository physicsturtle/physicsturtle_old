### Introduction

So far, we have only considered limits where $x$ is approaching some number. In this section, we allow for the possibility that $x$ goes to either positive or negative infinity. This leads to the idea of a horizontal asymptote. 







<ol>
<li> <div> Calculate the dot product between the vectors \(\textbf{a} = (3,1)\) and \(\textbf{b} = (-2,1)\). </div>

<button onclick="myFunction('answer1')" class="answerButton">Show Answer</button>
<div  id="answer1" class="answer">
This is a straightforward computation in two dimensions, which gives 
$$\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{b} = (3)(-2)+(1)(1) = -6 + 1 = -5$$ 
</div> </li>

</ol>
