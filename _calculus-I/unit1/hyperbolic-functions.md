### Introduction
We are all familiar with the sine, cosine, tangent, etc. functions. One term used to describe them all is the *circular functions*. This term is used because they relate to quantities on the *unit circle*; we can write $x = \cos\theta$ and $y = \sin\theta$ to describe any point on the unit circle $x^2+y^2 = 1$. What if we now wish to define a unit hyperbola, $x^2 - y^2 = 1$? How can we write $x$ and $y$ parametrically in terms of some variable analogous to the circular angle $\theta$? We define hyperbolic functions $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ such that if we set $x = \cosh \theta$ and $y = \sinh\theta$, then $x^2 - y^2 = 1$ for all values of $\theta$. 

First, let's review how we define the circular angle in terms of the area of a sector. 

In the figure, we see the unit hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 1$. Additionally, we define a hyperbolic angle in direct analogy to how we have defined a circular angle.
