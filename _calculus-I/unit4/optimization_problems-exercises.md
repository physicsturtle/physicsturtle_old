In this section, we will construct the Lagrangian for a two body central force problem, and then simplify it by using relative coordinates. The Lagrangian for two particles which interact with such a potential is the following:

$$\L = \frac{1}{2}\dot{\r}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}\dot{\r}_2^2 - U(|\r_1 - \r_2|)$$
