In this section, we will learn start finding formulas for derivatives. The simplest formula to find is the one for polynomials. It is the following. 

<div class="result">
The derivative of a polynomial expression $x^n$ is given by 
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}.$$
</div>

<div class="example">
$$f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{x^2}$$
$$f(x) = x^{5/2} - 3x^2$$
$$f(x) = x^\pi$$
$$f(x) = -2x^7 - \pi^e - 2x$$
</div>
