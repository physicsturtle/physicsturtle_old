In this section, we consider integrals with multivalued integrands. By multivalued integrands, we don't really mean that the original integral itself is multivalued; we will be considering real valued functions which of course have single values. However, when the real variable $x$ is replaced by the complex variable $z$, it causes the integrand to become multivalued, which makes choosing a contour more difficult. This is what we mean by multivalued integrands.

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example:</b> For $0 < \alpha < 1$, evaluate the integral
$$I = \int_{0}^\infty \frac{x^{\alpha - 1}}{x+1} dx.$$
</p>
<b>Solution:</b> To evaluate this integral, we first note that if we consider using the complex variable $z$ in $z^{\alpha - 1}$, we get a multivalued function because this can be written as 

$$z^{\alpha - 1} = e^{(\alpha - 1)\log z}.$$
