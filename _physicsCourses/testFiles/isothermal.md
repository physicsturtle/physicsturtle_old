### Introduction
An isothermal process is a process whereby the temperature stays constant throughout. Isothermal processes are a little bit more complicated to analyse than the ones we have analysed so far. 

### Work
The formula for work says 

$$dW = PdV$$

and we need to integrate both sides to find the work. However, $P$ is not constant, but is expressible in terms of $V$ through the ideal gas law. Thus 

$$dW = \frac{nRT}{V}dV$$

Now integrating both sides gives us 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
W &=& \int_{V_i}^{V_f} \frac{nRT}{V}dV \\
W &=& nRT\ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right) 
\end{eqnarray}$$
