The ideal gas law is a relationship between the quantities of $P$ pressure, $T$ temperature, $V$ volume, and $n$ number of moles, of a gas in a closed system. An ideal gas is one where 

1. the particles have low density; the average space between gas molecules is larger than the size of a molecule
2. 

The ideal gas law is 

$$PV = nRT$$

where $T$ is measured in Kelvin NOT Celsius, and $R$ is the ideal constant: $R = 8.31 J/mol/K$ in SI. It is also sometimes stated as 

$$PV = NkT$$

where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $k = 1.381\times 10^{-23} J/K$ in SI, and $k = R/N_A$, where $N_A$ is avogadro's number.
