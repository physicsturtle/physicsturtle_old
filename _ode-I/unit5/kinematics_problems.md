Among the most intuitive applications of differential calculus is kinematics problems. In physics, we describe the motion of a particle by specifying its position $x$ as a function of time $t$. This then allows us to calculate the particle's velocity $v$ and acceleration $a$ by taking derivatives:

$$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt},\qquad a(t) = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}.$$
