Zestymath is a mathematics education website that I have been wanting to build for a very long time. My vision for the website is to write course/reference material for a large variety of undergraduate topics in STEM. In particular, I would like to write about math and physics, and maybe some engineering or computer science as well. The secondary purpose of this project is to create content for me to read if I ever need to refer to topics which I have previously learned but need a refresher on. 

The aim of this website is not to allow you read about math, but to allow you to *do* math on your own with confidence. One of the things that I hope will make this website stand out is that I will very explicitly calculate everything, requiring the reader to fill in minimal details in derivations and solutions. That being said, there will be various exercises that the reader than do her/himself so that he/she can produce their own mathematics. The website was created on Tuesday June 12, 2018. 

The goals of the site can be summarized as follows:

1. To provide a comprehensive physics and mathematics reference, including explicit calculations, worked examples, and exercises; our goal is for the reader to be able to do their own calculations
2. To be a course supplement to physics and math courses, no matter what academic instutition you attend
3. To be an online open source textbook of mathematics and physics


Note: *Although I strive for accuracy, I do not guarantee the correctness of any information on this website.*

As for the author, I am currently an undergraduate studying Engineering Physics. I have been interested in education for a few years now, and have been trying to get this project off the ground for almost as long. Let's see where it goes.
