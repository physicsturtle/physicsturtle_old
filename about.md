The goals of the site can be summarized as follows:

1. To provide a comprehensive physics and mathematics reference, including explicit calculations, worked examples, and exercises; our goal is for the reader to be able to do their own calculations
2. To be a course supplement to physics and math courses, no matter what academic instutition you attend
3. To be an online open source textbook of mathematics and physics

Note: *Although I strive for accuracy, I do not guarantee the correctness of any information on this website.*

As for the author, I am currently a graduate student studying theoretical physics, in particular condensed matter. I have been interested in education for several years now, and have been trying to get this project off the ground for almost as long. The website was created on June 3, 2018. The website was last updated on {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" }}.
