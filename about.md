The goals of the site can be summarized as follows:

1. To provide a comprehensive physics and mathematics reference, including explicit calculations, worked examples, and exercises
2. To be a course supplement to physics and math courses, no matter what academic instutition you attend

I have organized the material here according to what my understanding of the conventional curriculum is for Canadian/American academic institutions. If you're from elsewhere, I hope it isn't too difficult for you to find what you need.

As for the author, I am currently a graduate student studying theoretical physics, in particular condensed matter. I have been interested in education for several years now, and have been trying to get this project off the ground for almost as long. The website was created on June 3, 2018, and I would like to have most of my planned content finished by 2030. The website was last updated on {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" }}.

Note: *Although I strive for accuracy, I do not guarantee the correctness of any information on this website.*
