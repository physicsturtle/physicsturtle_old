### Goal of this website
I hope that these notes will provide the interested student with a comprehensive overview of physics and mathematics content.

<!--- As for the author, I am currently a graduate student studying condensed matter physics. I have been interested in pedagogy for several years now, and have been trying to get this project off the ground for almost as long. The website was created on June 3, 2018, and I would like to have most of my planned content finished by 2030. The website was last updated on {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" }}. --->

<!---  ### How to use this website
There are numerous courses, each of which includes the text, examples, and exercises. One day I hope to include accompanying videos. I recommend that you read the text, and work through the examples as you read through. There are three types of exercises which should help you understand the material better, all of which are essential. The first type is an exercise which fills in gaps in the text, and such exercises occur more in the more advanced material. The second type is the application of results derived in the text. The third type is to make explicit connections with other material on the site. --->

#### Undergraduate Curriculum
Here is a rough trajectory of the order in which I think topics should be studied, which also provides a reasonable prerequisite path.

#### Graduate Notes

As a physicist working in condensed matter physics, I am only qualified to write on topics in statistical physics, quantum field theory, and of course condensed matter. Some courses which I am working on notes for include (with a rough schedule of when they might be accessible)
