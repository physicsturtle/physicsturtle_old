The goals of the site can be summarized as follows:

1. To provide a comprehensive physics and mathematics reference, including explicit calculations, worked examples, and exercises; our goal is for the reader to be able to do their own calculations
2. To be a course supplement to physics and math courses, no matter what academic instutition you attend
3. To be an online open source textbook of mathematics and physics

As for the author, I am currently an undergraduate studying Engineering Physics. I have been interested in education for a few years now, and have been trying to get this project off the ground for almost as long. Let's see where it goes.
