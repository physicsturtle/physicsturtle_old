Zestymath is a mathematics education website that I have been wanting to build for a very long time. My vision for the website is to write course material for a large variety of undergraduate topics in STEM. In particular, math and physics, and maybe some engineering as well. The secondary purpose of this project is to create content for me to read if I ever need to refer to topics which I have previously learned but need a refresher on. 

One of the things that I hope will make this website stand out is that I will very explicitly calculate everything, requiring the reader to fill in minimal details in derivations and solutions. The website was created on Tuesday June 12, 2018.
