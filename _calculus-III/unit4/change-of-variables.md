- the jacobian revisited
- Changing bounds of integration
- Changing the function of itnegration
- Changing the area element

The process of changing variables for functions of several variables in order to calculate an integral is not quite as simple as it is for a function of a single variable. This is because we now have many different derivative combinations that we can take! How can we combine these to appropriately scale our area or volume element?
