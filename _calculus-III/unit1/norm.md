Here we continue with the possible operations that one can do with vectors. The topic of this lesson is the *norm* of a vector. This is just a fancy word for the *length* or the *magnitude* of a vector. 

If we have a vector \\(\textbf{v} = (a,b)\\) in two dimensions, its magnitude, or norm, is defined as 

$$\|\textbf{v}\| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}.$$

Motivation for this definition can be seen through drawing a picture of this vector, and then using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length using the $x$ and $y$ components, $a$ and $b$, respectively. See the figure below.

An alternative notation for the norm is single bars instead of double bars:

$$|\textbf{v}| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2},$$

and we will mostly use single bars $\|\textbf{v}\|$. There is actually a distinction between the two notations, but it is beyond the scope of this course. Here they will be used interchangably. 

Similarly, this definition can be extended to three dimensions. For a vector in three dimensions $\textbf{v} = (a,b,c)$, its norm is 

$$|\textbf{v}| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}.$$

For the case of two dimensions, it is quite clear that the definition comes from the Pythagorean Theorem. However, what you might not have seen before is the Pythagorean Theorem extended to three dimensions. In three dimensions, we can first look at the projection of the vector into the $xy$ plane, so that the length of the projection is $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Then, this makes a new right angle triangle, whose side lengths are $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ and $c$. Thus, taking the square sum of these is $\|\textbf{v}\|^2 = \left(\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\right)^2 + c^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2$. This is why our definition makes sense.

Because the norm calculates the length of a vector, it is possible to find the distance between two points in space by using the norm. Taking the difference of two points creates as vector that points from one to the other, which we can then calculate the norm of. 

### Properties
The properties of the norm include:

#### Positivity
$$|\textbf{v}| \geq 0$$

#### Scalar Multiplication
$$\|\lambda\textbf{v}\| = |\lambda|\|\textbf{v}\| $$

#### Triangle Inequality
$$|\textbf{v} + \textbf{u}| \leq |\textbf{v}| + |\textbf{u}|$$
