- Definition of a line integral
- Work and flux in the plane, line integral of a vector field
- Line integral of a scalar field
- Work in space, line integral of a vector field
- Line integral of a scalar field

Line integrals, not unlike integrals in a single variable, allow us to integrate along a one dimensional path, but this path need not be straight anymore. This means that we can calculate quantities like the work required to move along this path. Line integrals for work can be calculated in both 2 or 3 dimensions, but line integrals for flux are defined only for 2 dimensions.
