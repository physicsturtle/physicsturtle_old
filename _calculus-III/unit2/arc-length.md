- Integration of a curve to find arc length
- Reparametrization of a curve by arc length
- Geometric advantages of parametrization by arc length

Here we will discuss how to calculate the arc length of a curve. Suppose we have a curve \\(\textbf{r}(t)\\) defined on an interval \\(t\in (a,b)\\). Then the length of the curve over the interval is 

$$L = \int_a^b |\textbf{r}'(t)| dt$$

The main purpose of learning to compute arc length is its use in reparametrization. One can reparametrize a curve in terms of its arc length, and this leads to a few nice properties.
