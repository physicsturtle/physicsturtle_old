In single variable calculus, we learned that the significance of the derivative was that it was the slope of the function at a point. Here, we will show that the concept of a derivative has the same geometric interpretation as before. However, this time we will be looking at *tangent planes* instead of tangent lines.


### Exercises

<ol>
<li> <div> Find the tangent plane to the surface \(z = x^2y - 3xy^3\) at the point \((2,1)\) </div>

<button onclick="myFunction('answer1')" class="answerButton">Show Answer</button>
<div  id="answer1" class="answer">
answer!
</div> </li>

<li> <div> Sketch all of the points such that \(y = 1\). </div>

<button onclick="myFunction('answer2')" class="answerButton">Show Answer</button>
<div  id="answer2" class="answer">
This is a plane that is parallel to the \(xz\) plane. 
</div> </li>
</ol>
