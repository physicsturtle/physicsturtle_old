\subsection{Inflection and Saddle Points}
A third case we did not mention before when finding extremal points with Lagrange multipliers is the case of inflection or saddle points. Consider the case shown. We can see that there is an inflection point of the curve of intersection of the graph and the constraint. Lagrange multipliers will actually locate this point as well! This means that it is possible for there to be only a single stationary point even on a closed bounded region % check this?
Now we present some examples that this occurs. Consider 
\[x^2+ y^2 = 1\] as the constraint, and the function
\[z = \theta^3 = \left(\arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\right)^3\]
as the function we want to optimize. This function has an inflection point on the \(x\) axis where the cylinder crosses the graph! Let's show this graphically, and using Lagrange Multipliers.
