If you have ever wanted to learn any topic, but have had difficulty motivating yourself, one good strategy is to give yourself a project. After completing a project, it becomes much easier to motivate oneself for further study in a particular field. On this page, I will list some interesting problems that can be solved without (relatively) low barrier to entry, and will help the reader to learn the basics. I am a theoretical physicist, so all of the projects I will list here can be completed by doing math on pen and paper, combined with some simple coding.
