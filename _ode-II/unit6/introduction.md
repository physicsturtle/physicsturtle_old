In your previous course on ODEs, you were exposed to the Laplace transform for the first time. In this course, we will introduce some new properties of the Laplace transform that allow us to solve more difficult problems. We recall that the Laplace transform of a function $f$ is  defined as:

<div class="definition">
<b>Definition:</b> The Laplace transform of a function $f$ is 
$$F(s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt,$$
where $s$ is a complex number. 
</div>
