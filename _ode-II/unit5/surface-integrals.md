Things you should understand after completing this lesson.

- Definition of a surface integral
- Surface of a graph
- Parametrized surface
- Flux through a surface -- integration of a vector field
- mass of a surface -- integration of a scalar field

We have already looked at how to calculate integrals of functions over regions of the \\(xy\\) plane. That was an integral over a *flat* region. Here, the concept of a surface integral allows us to calculate integrals of functions over a curvy surface! 

We can break surface integral problems into 4 different types. They are all solved the same way, but they all have different physical/geometric interpretations as to what they mean.

| | Vector Field | Scalar Field |
|--- |:---:|:---:|
| Vector Differential | \\(\displaystyle{\int \textbf{F}\cdot d\textbf{S}}\\), \\(\displaystyle{\int \textbf{F}\times d\textbf{S}}\\) | \\(\displaystyle{\int f d\textbf{S}}\\) |
|Scalar Differential | \\(\displaystyle{\int \textbf{F}dS}\\) | \\(\displaystyle{\int f dS}\\) |
